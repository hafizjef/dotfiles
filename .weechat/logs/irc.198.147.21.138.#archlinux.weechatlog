2013-06-23 15:15:47	OptimizedCoder	[10:40:31] Question about - feh - I have E17 - and have setup a script to run at boot with .xinitrc - using feh to load an image. .. but feh doesn't error out, but not load the image bg as well. Is e17 somehow blocking it? Anything worthwile to look at in /var/log/messages?
2013-06-23 15:15:47	Earnestly	[10:42:11] OptimizedCoder: You realise feh creates a .fehbg file when you use --bg-* that you can simply eval?
2013-06-23 15:15:47	Earnestly	[10:42:27] OptimizedCoder: e.g. `sh ~/.fehbg`
2013-06-23 15:15:47	OptimizedCoder	[10:42:51] Earnestly: I understand that - I cannot get the basic fh -bg-scale <image> command to work in the first place.
2013-06-23 15:15:47	Earnestly	[10:43:20] OptimizedCoder: Are you using `--bg-scale` or `-bg-scale`?
2013-06-23 15:15:47	OptimizedCoder	[10:44:52] Earnestly: holy shit - I'm an idiot -thanks,,
2013-06-23 15:15:47	OptimizedCoder	[10:49:20] ok, feh does work, but I need to know the correct arg to make it not be intrusive - nad hide my open apps and the taskbar

2013-06-27 01:29:58	luigi	[21:22:33] I'd rather not make it and find it doesn't work on windows...
2013-06-27 01:29:58	Earnestly	[21:22:35] luigi: Wait, what has Office got to do with it?
2013-06-27 01:29:58	Earnestly	[21:22:47] Office can read pdf's since when?
2013-06-27 01:29:58	demize	[21:22:53] Earnestly: Did you mean that like that their pdf forms don't follow the pdf standard? o.O
2013-06-27 01:29:58	demize	[21:23:05] Earnestly: Word can
2013-06-27 01:29:58	luigi	[21:23:06] Earnestly: Adobe Pro isn't on Linux, so how do I make it?
2013-06-27 01:29:58	Earnestly	[21:23:16] demize: Their forms don't work, flat out, in anything but acrobat reader. So I assume yes
2013-06-27 01:29:58	demize	[21:23:37] Earnestly: Does others forms work in other readers?
2013-06-27 01:29:58	Hwkiller	[21:23:40] LO can read and write out pdfs, and with forms too I think
2013-06-27 01:29:58	Earnestly	[21:23:46] luigi: You can make pdf forms in libre/openoffice

2013-06-27 01:29:58	Earnestly	[21:24:29] luigi: Pretty much every free pdf reader can use them, and if they can't, they can at least display them.
2013-06-27 01:29:58	Earnestly	[21:25:01] E.g. llpp can't fill out forms but it will display them. Best solution is t not use pdf at all
2013-06-27 01:29:58	luigi	[21:25:25] Earnestly: Will it work in reader?
2013-06-27 01:29:58	thrice	[21:25:30] could probably import it in to GIMP and just add text boxes :P
2013-06-27 01:29:58	demize	[21:25:31] Indeed, pdf is bleh

2013-06-27 01:29:58	Earnestly	[21:25:57] luigi: They do provide example documents with forums, try it and see
2013-06-27 01:29:58	Urne	[21:26:29] when pacman creates a mirrorlist.pacnew, is it then necessary to update the mirrorlist? I mean, if it is just a list of mirrors
2013-06-27 01:29:58	Byan	[21:26:52] hey guys, I'm having trouble getting arch to install in vmware
2013-06-27 01:29:58	luigi	[21:27:08] Byan: Did you read the wiki article on it? What defines 'trouble'?
2013-06-27 01:29:58	Byan	[21:27:20] when I do syslinux-install_update, it says FAILED to set attribute legacy bootle /dev/sda1
2013-06-27 01:29:58	demize	[21:27:25] Earnestly: There are apparently three different form types in pdf..
2013-06-27 01:29:58	Byan	[21:27:30] luigi: I didn't see anything about thsi in the article
2013-06-27 01:29:58	Earnestly	[21:27:36] luigi: http://openoffice.blogs.com/forms_fromscratch.pdf -> http://ytnoc.net/files/sampleapp.pdf
2013-06-27 01:29:58	Achillion	[21:27:48] Heading home. Thanks for the help with the stupid key combos!
2013-06-27 01:29:58	luigi	[21:27:54] Byan: That's a syslinux problem, not a vmware-cased issue
2013-06-27 01:29:58	Byan	[21:28:04] luigi: right, I agree
2013-06-27 01:29:58	Byan	[21:28:13] or well, maybe
2013-06-27 01:29:58	Byan	[21:28:17] but what am I doing wrong?
2013-06-27 01:29:58	demize	[21:28:17] scratch that. there are 4 types, but 2 that are used
2013-06-27 01:29:58	luigi	[21:28:32] Byan: Just use cfdisk to set /dev/sda1 bootable
2013-06-27 01:29:58	Earnestly	[21:29:18] demize: pdf is a container format
2013-06-27 01:29:58	Byan	[21:29:23] ok

2013-06-27 04:48:51	biax	ok, im now very confused. my understanding is quite traditional. we have a server and a client. the server (a daemon runnin in background) listens on port 1234. client connects to port 1234 and does its thing

2013-06-27 05:45:56	Apsu	vodik: Nothing. It's a token, of sorts, and eminently stealable; the goal is just to not have to store the plaintext passphrase, in case it's used elsewhere. Or just because.
2013-06-27 05:45:59	xeviox	anyways, if someone manages to get to my harddrive, he has direct access to all devices in the home network ..
2013-06-27 05:46:07	Apsu	vodik: It's not salted, to my knowledge, just a passphrase + SSID one-way hash.
