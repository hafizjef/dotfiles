2013-06-27 14:53:26	MonkeyDust	[10:39:08] Gycklarn  and Klipper
2013-06-27 14:53:26	wilee-nilee	[10:39:32] kelly, Your choice really 13.04 newest apps, 12.04 5 years support
2013-06-27 14:53:26	somsip	[10:39:33] Gycklarn: there are various clipboard managers but whether they let you import from a bast document to setup the buffers, you'd have to check
2013-06-27 14:53:26	MonkeyDust	[10:39:37] Gycklarn  and Parcellite
2013-06-27 14:53:26	somsip	[10:39:40] *base
2013-06-27 14:53:26	kelly	[10:40:13] thanx wilee , Is ubuntu 12.04 more stable than 13.04 ?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	MonkeyDust	[10:40:38] kelly  it's supported longer
2013-06-27 14:53:26	IdleOne	[10:41:01] Gycklarn: take a look at http://www.webupd8.org/2013/02/copyq-interesting-clipboard-manager.html
2013-06-27 14:53:26	wilee-nilee	[10:41:12] kelly, I find both stable, generally some will say a long term support is mopre stable 12.04LTS, but I have not found that necessarily true here.
2013-06-27 14:53:26	Gycklarn	[10:41:14] IdleOne, Ty
2013-06-27 14:53:26	iceroot	[10:42:30] kelly: yes, 12.04 is more stable because the software in 12.04 is testes for a longer time. the relase is older then a year, 13.04 is just out some month, so there was not that big testing like 12.04 get over the year
2013-06-27 14:53:26	iceroot	[10:42:41] kelly: but both are stable versions
2013-06-27 14:53:26	kelly	[10:43:21] thanx , can i ask here about elementary os ?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	iceroot	[10:43:35] kelly: no
2013-06-27 14:53:26	iceroot	[10:43:40] kelly: only ubuntu support
2013-06-27 14:53:26	kelly	[10:43:42] ok
2013-06-27 14:53:26	kelly	[10:44:51] Is Intel 3000 HD good with unity ?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	mumpitze1	[10:45:02]  good enough
2013-06-27 14:53:26	iceroot	[10:45:23] kelly: its running fine, i am using that card here with 13.04
2013-06-27 14:53:26	iceroot	[10:45:34] kelly: its even fine to play source games on steam
2013-06-27 14:53:26	kelly	[10:46:51] i don't play games at all , i need a good program for video editing ?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	iceroot	[10:47:30] kelly:

2013-06-27 14:53:26	kelly	[10:48:51] thank you for the quick response :)
2013-06-27 14:53:26	ntzrmtthihu777	[10:49:20] hallo. I've been getting into manually networking in ubuntu, problem is, I have to leave the terminal open after running dhclient, even if I do it with & at the end. is there a way to really background it?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	kelly	[10:49:50] What would be the best partitioning set up for a fresh install of ubuntu 12.04 with SSD ?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	iceroot	[10:50:14] kelly: use the one ubuntu will suggest
2013-06-27 14:53:26	iceroot	[10:50:33] kelly: there is no "best" partition layout for an ssd (or a normal hdd)
2013-06-27 14:53:26	ntzrmtthihu777	[10:50:34] kelly: no such thing as best, but I personally do a 16gb root, as much swap as i feel needed, and the rest for /home
2013-06-27 14:53:26	iceroot	[10:51:07] kelly: its all depending on your needs, if you dont know you needs, use the ubuntu default layout
2013-06-27 14:53:26	kelly	[10:51:10] someone told me to putting swap, and maybe /var and /tmp on the harddisk. is it good
2013-06-27 14:53:26	kelly	[10:51:33] I've 256GB SSD + 500GB HDD + 250GB HDD
2013-06-27 14:53:26	ntzrmtthihu777	[10:51:44]  /var and /tmp are by default on disc
2013-06-27 14:53:26	wheatthin	[10:51:49] using ssd, depending on it's speed would usually be for swap, or at least a portion of it
2013-06-27 14:53:26	ntzrmtthihu777	[10:52:06] wheatthin: and /boot :P
2013-06-27 14:53:26	wheatthin	[10:52:24] ehh, files on boot aren't used often unless rebooting
2013-06-27 14:53:26	wheatthin	[10:52:35] and they are quite small as it is
2013-06-27 14:53:26	ntzrmtthihu777	[10:52:38] yeah, but hey, boot speed is a good thing :P
2013-06-27 14:53:26	wheatthin	[10:52:53] should have good boot speed either way right?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	wheatthin	[10:52:55] :)
2013-06-27 14:53:26	ntzrmtthihu777	[10:53:10] true, this is *buntu we're talking about, not windows :P
2013-06-27 14:53:26	wheatthin	[10:53:29] ntzrmtthihu777, most of the files used for booting and loading services aren't located on /boot
2013-06-27 14:53:26	wheatthin	[10:53:36] the descriptors are
2013-06-27 14:53:26	ntzrmtthihu777	[10:53:55] ... perhaps I've misread something, then...
2013-06-27 14:53:26	kelly	[10:54:15] yesterday i tried one of the heaviest disto and the boot time is 8 sec , i think ubuntu will be more faster :)

2013-06-28 10:10:01	excelsiora	[05:34:01] I don't know how to get cleared to do so... yet
2013-06-28 10:10:01	wilee-nilee	[05:34:02] excelsiora, This is support chat is at #ubuntu-offtopic
2013-06-28 10:10:01	excelsiora	[05:34:21] You're supporting my Ubuntu habit. :)
2013-06-28 10:10:01	bazhang	[05:34:30] excelsiora, take it there
2013-06-28 10:10:01	Teh_Bucket	[05:35:20] anyone know how to setup the widgets in compiz?
2013-06-28 10:10:01	Teh_Bucket	[05:35:35] i managed to add only one window at a time, can't add more than 1
2013-06-28 10:10:01	excelsiora	[05:35:35] ok, support this: my laptop is a Dell studio 1558, and the backlight doesn't respond to the special dimmer keys. What's up with that?
2013-06-28 10:10:01	excelsiora	[05:35:49] oh yeah, 13.04, 64 bit.
2013-06-28 10:10:01	excelsiora	[05:37:11] although the keyboard lights worked on install, go figure
2013-06-28 10:10:01	excelsiora	[05:38:05] When I installed 11.10, the keyboard lights didn't work, but the screen dimmer did.
2013-06-28 10:10:01	excelsiora	[05:38:36] Why can't hardware guys standardize?!
2013-06-28 10:10:01	harris	[05:38:41] ubuntu 13.04 power saving makes pc pop
2013-06-28 10:10:01	mehwork	[05:40:28] i don't have the command 'add-apt-repository' in my ubuntu. How can i get it?
2013-06-28 10:10:01	newborn	[05:41:29] try "aptitude search add-apt-repository"
2013-06-28 10:10:01	harris	[05:41:52] ubuntu 13.04 power saving makes pc pop
2013-06-28 10:10:01	mehwork	[05:42:07] newborn: i did and it didnt turn anything up
2013-06-28 10:10:01	excelsiora	[05:42:14] harris: what the hell are you talking about?
2013-06-28 10:10:01	xangua	[05:42:41] are you on server¿
2013-06-28 10:10:01	xangua	[05:42:42] !find add-apt-repository | mehwork
2013-06-28 10:10:01	ubottu	[05:42:45] mehwork: File add-apt-repository found in software-properties-common

2013-06-28 10:10:01	mehwork	[05:43:19] thanks ubottu
2013-06-28 10:10:01	excelsiora	[05:43:22] I don't know, I've never had that issue
2013-06-28 10:10:01	excelsiora	[05:43:32] you have the proper driver?
2013-06-28 10:10:01	excelsiora	[05:43:55] I don't know all the bash commands to figure out your hardware
2013-06-28 10:10:01	harris	[05:45:02] fixed it
2013-06-28 10:10:01	BAMbanda	[05:45:42] how do I close a process similar to task manager in windows?
2013-06-28 10:10:01	excelsiora	[05:45:58] ?
2013-06-28 10:10:01	newborn	[05:46:19] is there a command like "yum provides *bin/add-apt-repository" to search packages that provides the file "add-apt-repository" on ubuntu?
2013-06-28 10:10:01	excelsiora	[05:46:19] BAMbanda: top
2013-06-28 10:10:01	BAMbanda	[05:46:24] like if something is not responding, firefox says there is a process already running and I have to close it
2013-06-28 10:10:01	excelsiora	[05:46:33] and kill the pid
2013-06-28 10:10:01	BAMbanda	[05:46:33] after top, how do i quit a specific app
2013-06-28 10:10:01	BAMbanda	[05:46:36] ok gotcha
2013-06-28 10:10:01	wilee-nilee	[05:46:37] BAMbanda, I often use killall "app" if you find the pid you can kill with that.
2013-06-28 10:10:01	excelsiora	[05:46:40] I think
2013-06-28 10:10:01	BAMbanda	[05:46:48] cool
2013-06-28 10:10:01	excelsiora	[05:47:09] newborn: ??
2013-06-28 10:10:01	excelsiora	[05:48:01] newborn: what's your error message when you try to run it?
2013-06-28 10:10:01	OerHeks	[05:48:52] newborn, that command is given already > aptitude search add-apt-repository
2013-06-28 10:10:01	newborn	[05:49:46] not works for search files in packages,it just search package name or pack description OerHeks
2013-06-28 10:10:01	OerHeks	[05:51:21] newborn, oh i see, dpkg-deb -I <filename>
2013-06-28 10:10:01	excelsiora	[05:52:12] Is it bad to use the command line to sudo apt-get update or should I just use the GUI?
2013-06-28 10:10:01	Jef91	[05:52:46] Anyone here know if Ubiquity in 13.04 uses python2 or 3 gtk bindings?

2013-06-28 12:40:41	cptcel23	[08:12:27] has anyone noticed their bluetooth scanning breaking recently?
2013-06-28 12:40:41	guest11111	[08:12:53] Is Unity a Different desktop enviroment or a shell for gnome?
2013-06-28 12:40:41	cgtdk	[08:13:02] guest11111: a shell for GNOME
2013-06-28 12:40:41	whoever	[08:13:03] cptcel23: go with 12.10 not bleeding edge
2013-06-28 12:40:41	cptcel23	[08:13:25] atm i have to sit on a cold floor using my ps/2 keyboard and it's killing my back - getting bluetooth working would be really good ;)
2013-06-28 12:40:41	cgtdk	[08:13:35] guest11111: Although it could be considered its own desktop environment despite being a shell for GNOME
2013-06-28 12:40:41	whoever	[08:14:00] cptcel23:  get a chair
2013-06-28 12:40:41	guest11111	[08:14:11] thanks cgtdk
2013-06-28 12:40:41	wilee-nilee	[08:15:35] guest11111, Not correct unity is a plugin in compiz running in top of gnome 3.
2013-06-28 12:40:41	wilee-nilee	[08:15:42] on*
2013-06-28 12:40:41	phix	[08:16:51] guest11111: I am not here
2013-06-28 12:40:41	guest11111	[08:17:13] ubuntu releases are released every 6 months right?
2013-06-28 12:40:41	cgtdk	[08:17:17] yes
2013-06-28 12:40:41	phix	[08:17:24] hmmm I get random crash notifications poping up every now and then
2013-06-28 12:40:42	cptcel23	[08:17:36] whoever, thanks for that helpful tip.. is there a wiki page i can add that workaround somewhere? bluetooth keyboard isn't working - buy a chair and a ps/2? ;)
2013-06-28 12:40:42	phix	[08:17:58] cptcel23: Gold advice :)
2013-06-28 12:40:42	cptcel23	[08:19:35] well if anyone has any ideas on how to make my existing furniture compatible with ubuntu it would be super appreciated

2013-06-28 12:40:42	cptcel23	[08:22:21] i would also add - if i set the computer to discoverable, my phone can't detect it either, so it doesn't work in either direction
2013-06-28 12:40:42	cgtdk	[08:22:39] asharas: I have no idea what that means. Try querying your preferred search engine if no one else can help you.
2013-06-28 12:40:42	scubasteve	[08:22:51] so i thought 13.04 didnt have wubi anymore, so i downloaded 13.04 iso and... i see wubi. im confused?
2013-06-28 12:40:42	wilee-nilee	[08:23:12] scubasteve, Not usable though.
2013-06-28 12:40:42	scubasteve	[08:23:23] then why is it in the official iso?
2013-06-28 12:40:42	asharas	[08:23:26] already searching ^^
2013-06-28 12:40:42	wilee-nilee	[08:23:46] scubasteve, Just a remnant.
2013-06-28 12:40:42	scubasteve	[08:24:01] hm alright. i thought i maybe had the wrong version or something some how. thanks
2013-06-28 12:40:42	wilee-nilee	[08:24:45] scubasteve, I believe though that inspite of it not being supported a loaded 13.04 version somewhere.

2013-06-28 12:40:42	phix	[08:33:52] ok, playing music on Rhythmbox over wireless network, it keeps stopping to buffer, can I increase buffer size in Rhythmbox?
2013-06-28 12:40:42	luke1	[08:34:05] hello everybody
2013-06-28 12:40:42	felixonmars	[08:36:10] Hi, could I find a kernel for lucid that >=3.0 and built for i386? (not i686 as the backport lts one)
2013-06-28 12:40:42	james41382	[08:36:52] phix: are there a lot of people with wireless networks near you?
2013-06-28 12:40:42	wilee-nilee	[08:38:03] felixonmars, lucid dektop is end of life and not supported, the server is though.
2013-06-28 12:40:42	wilee-nilee	[08:38:18] desktop*
2013-06-28 12:40:42	felixonmars	[08:38:19] wilee-nilee: yeah, i meant for the server
2013-06-28 12:40:42	wilee-nilee	[08:38:28] cool
2013-06-28 12:40:42	felixonmars	[08:39:18] i need 6rd thus >=2.6.35, and R6040 driver which only enabled in even newer ubuntu kernels, but the machine does not support cmov
2013-06-28 12:40:42	phix	[08:39:21] james41382: 3 devices on the same 802.11n router (openwrt, dlink something)
2013-06-28 12:40:42	phix	[08:39:48] james41382: I have decent reception, just wondering if I can increase the buffer so I get a smoother playback
2013-06-28 12:40:42	james41382	[08:40:53] i am not sure about increasing the buffer size with rhythmbox, but crowded channels when you are using wifi can put a damper on connection speed.

I have a GPT disk with several partitions on it. 100MB (previously for EFI), 15GB Ubuntu /, 15GB Fedora /, and 200GB /home, along with swap as well. I formatted the 100MB EFI partition to FAT32 and gave it a bios_grub flag, but even after reinstalling, it didn't work. Is this setup incorrect?

2013-07-03 08:51:29	uhelp	Бородин?
2013-07-03 08:51:32	Belial`	yes, it can be used as an applet.
2013-07-03 08:51:36	reisio	Belial`: if so it's probably not easy to install, short of installing MATE (which is GNOME 2)
2013-07-03 08:51:47	reisio	Belial`: might want to check https://extensions.gnome.org/ for an analogue

I get all those "link is slow to respond, please be patient (ready=0)" and "hard resetting link" in dmesg before it will give up and give me read error. If it would give up without trying I could save a lot of time.

I've done nvidia-setting and the driver says "You do not appear to be using the NVIDIA X driver.  Please edit your X configuration file (just run `nvidia-xconfig` as root), and restart the X server." i've done this and nothing changes.

2013-07-03 11:07:21	nurow3	Hello everyone, I've been having an issue where after installing Ubuntu on one of my hard drives, I was unable to boot to my other drive with Windows 7 (getting grub errors). Great people in this channel advised me to try to recover the partition, but I never could. However, I just remembered that the partition is actually a TrueCrypt partition. How should I go about trying to recover that?

2013-07-03 17:07:28	Chadman	[12:55:14] anybody who can help me on this?
2013-07-03 17:07:28	histo	[12:55:16] wooo_: you created a new partition and wrote a new filesystem to it for whatever reason. So .....
2013-07-03 17:07:28	bazhang	[12:55:34] zoie, it brings in those packages. it does not change from 13.04
2013-07-03 17:07:28	Chadman	[12:55:34] anybody?
2013-07-03 17:07:28	histo	[12:55:35] Chadman: what like manycam?
2013-07-03 17:07:28	Chadman	[12:55:43] yes, histo.
2013-07-03 17:07:28	wooo_	[12:55:55] histo: So ? everything is lost ? or still any hope ?
2013-07-03 17:07:28	histo	[12:55:58] Chadman: use webcamstudio
2013-07-03 17:07:28	zoie	[12:56:11] sorry i don't understand what you mean
2013-07-03 17:07:28	Chadman	[12:56:18] histo, (example): in manycam, manycam creates a virtual-webcam that we can use to display images/movies on it (like a video source or something)
2013-07-03 17:07:28	histo	[12:56:21] wooo_: You may be able to recover some things with file carvers such as photorec, foremost, or scalpel
2013-07-03 17:07:28	Chadman	[12:56:27] I did, histo. It didn't work out.
2013-07-03 17:07:28	histo	[12:56:37] wooo_: http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec_Step_By_Step
2013-07-03 17:07:28	Chadman	[12:56:44] any other way?
2013-07-03 17:07:28	Chadman	[12:56:47] like v4l2loopback?
2013-07-03 17:07:28	histo	[12:56:51] wooo_: You already have photorec since you installed testdisk
2013-07-03 17:07:28	Chadman	[12:56:57] histo, are you aware of v4l2loopback?
2013-07-03 17:07:28	histo	[12:57:42] Chadman: what's wrong with webcamstudio?
2013-07-03 17:07:28	wooo_	[12:58:13] histo: So should I stop testdisk ? Its running . Analyzing cylinders 10375/60800 17%.
2013-07-03 17:07:28	Chadman	[12:58:25] histo, I want to show an image on it, but it doesn't work.
2013-07-03 17:07:28	Chadman	[12:58:55] histo, like I selected a image, and pressed play, and when the virtual-webcam doesn't appear in webcam-selecting options of livestream-sites.
2013-07-03 17:07:28	histo	[12:58:56] wooo_: well let testdisk finish and see if it finds paritions but I doubt it.
2013-07-03 17:07:28	Chadman	[12:59:02] histo, it also says "no output"
2013-07-03 17:07:28	wooo_	[12:59:09] histo: okay.
2013-07-03 17:07:28	Chadman	[12:59:09] so webcamstudio is pretty useless.
2013-07-03 17:07:28	Chadman	[12:59:21] histo, any other way? like mplayer, v4l2loopback, vloopback?
2013-07-03 17:07:28	Chadman	[13:00:13] ?
2013-07-03 17:07:28	Chadman	[13:00:37] I have both, v4l2loopback, gstreamer...etc everything installed.
2013-07-03 17:07:28	Chadman	[13:00:54] A guy was helping me out last night, but he vanished. he just said "cd into the directory where you have the gif"
2013-07-03 17:07:28	Chadman	[13:00:58] and vanished.
2013-07-03 17:07:28	Chadman	[13:01:03] I want to display a gif on my virtual webcam.
2013-07-03 17:07:28	lotuspsychje	[13:01:14] !patience | Chadman
2013-07-03 17:07:28	ubottu	[13:01:15] Chadman: Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly; if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. While you wait, try searching https://help.ubuntu.com/ or http://ubuntuforums.org/ or http://askubuntu.com/

2013-07-03 17:07:28	Chadman	[13:01:52] v4l2loopback is the perfect solution for this, but how can I use it?

2013-07-03 18:10:01	junctions	Hello people. I'm trying to fiddle with the router at a computer far far away. I normally do everything there through SSH, however this seems that it requires a browser. w3m doesn't work with the router. Firefox is unusably slow (when using ssh  -X). What is the most lightweight GUI www-browser in the ubuntu repository to your experience?
