2013-06-27 01:29:58	+ispirto	[21:24:16] debian, ubuntu, centos uses pxe

2013-06-27 01:29:58	+tehKitten	[21:26:04] We strongly recommend for you to take these steps to secure your VPS:
2013-06-27 01:29:58	+tehKitten	[21:26:05] 1. Change your SSH port number.
2013-06-27 01:29:58	+tehKitten	[21:26:16] joepie91: didn't you call that bullshit?
2013-06-27 01:29:58	rm	[21:28:56] that's b/s if that's all you do
2013-06-27 01:29:58	rm	[21:29:26] "1." should have been "configure key-based auth and disable passwords"
2013-06-27 01:29:58	+tehKitten	[21:29:56] ispirto: where can I find vnc info
2013-06-27 01:29:58	+ispirto	[21:30:11] there is no external vnc tehKitten
2013-06-27 01:29:58	+ispirto	[21:30:14] you need to use the java applet
2013-06-27 01:29:58	+manacit	[21:30:15] changing ssh ports is about as useful as adding a '1' to the end of your password that is 'password'
2013-06-27 01:29:58	+tehKitten	[21:30:19] >.>
2013-06-27 01:29:58	+tehKitten	[21:30:34] that sucks
2013-06-27 01:29:58	rm	[21:30:35] well manacit if you change it tooooooo some 65381
2013-06-27 01:29:58	+tehKitten	[21:30:45] for java is a piece of shit

2013-06-27 01:37:27	+ispirto	i dont know how that is a problem
2013-06-27 01:37:43	+tehKitten	because that is not how I expect kvm to work
2013-06-27 01:37:58	+tehKitten	one of the reasons I started looking at kvm was for the vnc available

2013-06-27 04:40:43	+tehKitten	but I unmounted the openbsd iso, mounted the rescue cd, and pressed the reboot button

2013-06-27 04:40:48	+tehKitten	how come that does not clear ram
2013-06-27 04:40:56	+BradND	it doesnt kill the qemu process

2013-06-27 04:41:11	sergeys_	=\
2013-06-27 04:41:13	+BradND	the reboot is handled by the qemu process not the OS

2013-06-27 04:42:05	+BradND	:D
2013-06-27 04:42:25	+BradND	the OS inside QEMU can obviously clear the RAM

2013-06-27 04:46:28	+joepie91	apparently caused by KVM not really restarting the process when restarting the VPS, thus info remaining in RAM
