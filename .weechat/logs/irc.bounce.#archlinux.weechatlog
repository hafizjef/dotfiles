2013-06-27 05:53:55	biax	[01:52:40] it actually had some numbers like 1001:504... i chown'd it to root:root

2013-06-27 05:53:55	biax	[01:53:08] but why would systemd give me no such file or dir when the file exists
2013-06-27 05:53:55	biax	[01:53:25] [Requesting program interpreter: /lib/ld-linux.so.2]
2013-06-27 05:53:55	grawity	[01:53:43] 1) it is not systemd; it is the kernel
2013-06-27 05:53:55	grawity	[01:53:52] 2) it doesn't say *which* file doesn't exist
2013-06-27 05:53:55	grawity	[01:54:04] for example, does "/lib/ld-linux.so.2" exist on your system?
2013-06-27 05:53:55	Apsu	[01:54:22] demize: Nothing forces you, yes, but generally it's the point of salting, to avoid the ability to precompute rainbow tables ;P
2013-06-27 05:53:55	biax	[01:54:27] no
2013-06-27 05:53:55	demize	[01:54:29] It would be odd if it didn't..
2013-06-27 05:53:55	Apsu	[01:54:31] Not that precomputing SSID tables would be easy...
2013-06-27 05:53:55	demize	[01:54:35] Apsu: true
2013-06-27 05:53:55	Apsu	[01:54:40] That's probably a rather large possible 'salt' space.

2013-06-27 05:56:31	crackerz	Hello all. I tried to do an ArchLinux build using the software raid configuration. I followed the steps for configuring a Raid as defined by the wiki but made a mistake (didn't leave room for grub). I decided to scrap the idea so I used dd to write /dev/zero to both of my 2TB hard drives... The raid device is still showing up and when I try to issue the command 'mdadm --zero-superblock /dev/sda' I get the error 'mdadm: couldn't open /dev/sda
2013-06-27 05:56:32	crackerz	for write -- not zeroing'

2013-06-27 06:21:26	Vlavv_	Hello, I broke my Arch install after trying to migrate to systemd in an OpenVZ container. Even after adding the init=... parameter in my kernel line of my menu.lst, it was still using initscripts. So I installed systemd-sysvcompat (which replaced the initscripts package), and now it's not booting at all.
2013-06-27 06:21:27	clcto	plol: i think you put it in the grub-defaults file or something like that.

2013-06-27 14:53:26	CryptoMole	[10:17:35] hey all I have not updateded in along time
2013-06-27 14:53:26	jdahm	[10:17:56] I hope some memory or the hd didnt just fail
2013-06-27 14:53:26	CryptoMole	[10:18:31] is this new sytemd difficult
2013-06-27 14:53:26	savio	[10:19:01] hi all
2013-06-27 14:53:26	savio	[10:19:14] i'm ubuntu user and want to install Arch
2013-06-27 14:53:26	savio	[10:19:21] any suggestion
2013-06-27 14:53:26	savio	[10:19:24] ?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	savio	[10:19:56] i'm thinking going virtual way first
2013-06-27 14:53:26	CryptoMole	[10:20:15] hey liberation you ant no  liberal are ya
2013-06-27 14:53:26	strcpy	[10:21:20] jdahm: can you compare output of "ldd /usr/bin/htop" vs. "ldd /usr/bin/top"?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	jdahm	[10:22:39] strcpy, top doesnt link to anything it says, htop links to libm, libc, and libncurses primarily
2013-06-27 14:53:26	CryptoMole	[10:22:59] where are the conservatives
2013-06-27 14:53:26	strcpy	[10:23:01] jdahm: does pacman still work?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	jdahm	[10:24:14] strcpy, yeah pacman -Qi htop returns the info
2013-06-27 14:53:26	hansarsch	[10:24:42] hi world
2013-06-27 14:53:26	strcpy	[10:24:58] jdahm: pacman -Qk top (k: check if files are there.)?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	hansarsch	[10:25:32] i am attempting to solve a problem. in doing so I need to find the PID of a tty into which i am not logged in yet. if i ty ps aux | grep 'tty' I don't get any tty process, except for the grep process itself. how do I get that PID?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	jdahm	[10:25:33] package 'top' was not found
2013-06-27 14:53:26	phiber2k4	[10:25:59] i am attempting to solve a problem. in doing so I need to find the PID of a tty into which i am not logged in yet. if i ty ps aux | grep 'tty' I don't get any tty process, except for the grep process itself. how do I get that PID?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	strcpy	[10:27:14] i think i may have heard that nowadays systemd spawns those ttys on demand
2013-06-27 14:53:26	hansarsch	[10:27:34] oh. so that means the process doesn't exist if not used?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	jdahm	[10:28:06] strcpy, pacman -Qk xorg-server-common says 0 files, 0 files missing
2013-06-27 14:53:26	strcpy	[10:28:11] dont ask me for any details, i dont know sorry. Just heard that systemd spawns them on demand here yesterday i think
2013-06-27 14:53:26	hansarsch	[10:28:23] ok thanks a lot!
2013-06-27 14:53:26	strcpy	[10:29:19] jdahm: is it installed? pacman -Q | grep xorg-server-common
2013-06-27 14:53:26	strcpy	[10:30:02] for me: xorg-server-common: 15 total files, 0 missing files
2013-06-27 14:53:26	hansarsch	[10:30:57] basically, the reason I am trying to strace a tty login is that I find a ~ 10 seconds lag in my SLIM login manager before I can enter my password. This issue has not been the case and I wouldn't expect it with my current hardware (SSD). any ideas on how I can look into what is 'blocking' the login process?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	hansarsch	[10:31:41] systemd-analyze shows a total startup time of 3.9 seconds. and the lag is much longer
2013-06-27 14:53:26	jdahm	[10:35:01] I just tried to reistall a package and ldd now says almost every lib is empty
2013-06-27 14:53:26	eppa	[10:35:13] hansarsch: hostname in /etc/hosts with 127.0.0.1 address?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	hansarsch	[10:36:18] eppa. there is!
2013-06-27 14:53:26	hansarsch	[10:38:30] eppa should it not be there? sorry for my noobness regarding this matter
2013-06-27 14:53:26	strcpy	[10:40:10] jdahm: can you view the /var/log/pacman.log with less? any strange things in there?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	john_f	[10:40:15] jdahm: top is in procps-ng...maybe you need an fsck?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	ron_frown	[10:40:59] is there a trick to searching pacman packages?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	ron_frown	[10:41:03] at command line I mean
2013-06-27 14:53:26	ron_frown	[10:41:17] eg, if I want to see what pacman has available for qt
2013-06-27 14:53:26	strcpy	[10:41:22] ron_frown: pacman -Ss qt
2013-06-27 14:53:26	ron_frown	[10:42:05] shit sorry... I thought I already tried that
2013-06-27 14:53:26	ovidiu-florin	[10:46:25] I have set an alias em='emacs -nw' în .bashrc in both my user and the root user. and when I run sudo em /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist I get a em command not found. why?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	jdahm	[10:46:32] John_f yes i think that might be it  procps-ng was one of the packages i upgraded
2013-06-27 14:53:26	john_f	[10:47:22] jdahm: do you have the fsck mkinitcpio hook?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	jdahm	[10:47:46] I dont have internet on the laptop  i could install an older package  would that help?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	john_f	[10:49:03] I would just reinstall what was upgraded.
2013-06-27 14:53:26	jdahm	[10:49:32] Yes, i have it at the end  i shouls note grub was also upgraded and im holding back the kernel atm at an older version (3.9.2)
2013-06-27 14:53:26	jdahm	[10:51:58] Pacman is acting really weirdly  maybe an fs problem  also ldd still says lots of libs are empty...

2013-06-28 10:10:01	dino-	[05:59:46] But nothing about it anywhere else in Partitioning, Syslinux, or what-have-you pages
2013-06-28 10:10:01	Almehdin	[05:59:49] nixfreak: then that is your /boot and not the entire rootfs
2013-06-28 10:10:01	nixfreak	[05:59:50] ok so fdisk sda1 is boot
2013-06-28 10:10:01	dino-	[06:00:04] <- super new to GPT
2013-06-28 10:10:01	nixfreak	[06:00:12] let me try sda3
2013-06-28 10:10:01	Almehdin	[06:00:59] nixfreak: youcould lsblk or 'sudo blkid'
2013-06-28 10:10:01	madprops	[06:01:57] cinelli, I'm going to try telling grub next, but wouldn't specifying that directly means I'd have to do it everytime the kernel is upgraded
2013-06-28 10:10:01	KYLEtheBAKER	[06:02:25] is it feasable/worth it to image my current setup, install it as a virtual machine, and use it to test if mass updates will break my system?
2013-06-28 10:10:01	vodik	[06:02:38] nixfreak: you don't just have to mount /, you have yo mount /proc,/sys,etc ontop of /
2013-06-28 10:10:01	KYLEtheBAKER	[06:02:39] i guess i would need to adjust the harddrive size on the virtual install so it would fit
2013-06-28 10:10:01	Almehdin	[06:03:19] vodik: He did and arch-chroot but had just mounted /boot .. so are fixing it ;)
2013-06-28 10:10:01	KYLEtheBAKER	[06:03:26] hearing about people having problems after updates makes me nervous, i've spent a lot of time getting everything set up
2013-06-28 10:10:01	nixfreak	[06:04:07] yeah used that before I have sda --> sda1 102mb sda2 258.9mb sda3 253Gb sda4 210gb
2013-06-28 10:10:01	vodik	[06:04:11] KYLEtheBAKER: updating what?
2013-06-28 10:10:01	nixfreak	[06:04:35] sda2 is swap cause its 82
2013-06-28 10:10:01	nixfreak	[06:05:03] sda3 is 83 and sda4 is 84
2013-06-28 10:10:01	KYLEtheBAKER	[06:05:19] vodik: im not sure, just updating all my packages with pacman
2013-06-28 10:10:01	Almehdin	[06:05:40] nixfreak: Then sda3 it should be
2013-06-28 10:10:01	Almehdin	[06:05:55] nixfreak: mount it and look
2013-06-28 10:10:01	nixfreak	[06:05:58] yeah I have that mounted now
2013-06-28 10:10:01	nixfreak	[06:06:03] going to chroot
2013-06-28 10:10:01	nixfreak	[06:06:13] ok so that chroot
2013-06-28 10:10:01	nixfreak	[06:07:48] ok I'm not seeing grub at all

2013-06-28 12:40:43	Byan	[08:37:27] I'm confused about locale-gen. I tried to use mosh, but it said I needed UTF-8 native locale. so I checked /etc/locale.gen, saw it looked enabled
2013-06-28 12:40:43	Byan	[08:37:33] and then I reran locale-gen
2013-06-28 12:40:43	Byan	[08:37:49] but when I type locale I don't see any UTF-8
2013-06-28 12:40:43	Byan	[08:37:52] and mosh doewn't work
2013-06-28 12:40:43	cinelli	[08:38:03] nixfreak: Your config is on /dev/sda1 right? and it's MBR or GPT partition?

2013-07-03 08:03:40	Apsu	[03:59:58] zendeavor: I was using xmonad uphill both ways in the snow when you were just a glimmer in your pimp daddy's eye!

2013-07-03 08:03:40	Earnestea	[04:00:13] zendeavor: Well you didn't, in fact, when I asked you how to rearrange the layout you said "You plan ahead"
2013-07-03 08:03:40	zendeavor	[04:00:16] he was good to me =[
2013-07-03 08:03:40	SevereOverfl0w	[04:00:24] kevr: Termite just installed..
2013-07-03 08:03:40	zendeavor	[04:00:31] Earnestea: i didn't say i did a good job teaching you
2013-07-03 08:03:40	SevereOverfl0w	[04:00:32] There's a moment of scaredness right now.
2013-07-03 08:03:40	kevr	[04:00:32] SevereOverfl0w: You came?
2013-07-03 08:03:40	Apsu	[04:00:35] zendeavor is full of helpful information. Like "GFY" and "Learn to read"
2013-07-03 08:03:40	kevr	[04:00:37] oh
2013-07-03 08:03:40	Earnestea	[04:00:38] :D
2013-07-03 08:03:40	SevereOverfl0w	[04:00:41] kevr: That's a bit personal.
2013-07-03 08:03:40	keenerd	[04:00:42] Apsu: Xmonad sucked back then.  They had this bug that broke VNC, the remote client thought you always had the alt button pressed.
2013-07-03 08:03:40	kevr	[04:00:45] my bad
2013-07-03 08:03:40	Apsu	[04:01:04] keenerd: Yus. It sure did. And Java apps were a hellish nightmare. Fuck you DRAC, fuck you.
2013-07-03 08:03:40	SevereOverfl0w	[04:01:06] kevr: A nice clean start...
2013-07-03 08:03:40	SevereOverfl0w	[04:01:15] Though, for some reason my hostname has an underline
2013-07-03 08:03:40	Earnestea	[04:01:26] Another feature of i3 which you can't even do with xmonad, bind using the keycode when lacking a keysym…
2013-07-03 08:03:40	endiruna	[04:01:32] what is so nice of i3 or in general having a manual window tiling? wouldnt it be better something like awesomewm or xmonad?
2013-07-03 08:03:40	raininja	[04:01:35] java IS the web, though
2013-07-03 08:03:40	cinelli	[04:01:38] SevereOverfl0w: underlines are cool these days
2013-07-03 08:03:40	kevr	[04:01:43] SevereOverfl0w: Go checkout the README.rst on stinger's github
2013-07-03 08:03:40	keenerd	[04:01:47] i3 has plenty of issues though.

2013-07-03 08:03:40	kevr	[04:01:55] it has a complete ton of hotkeys he embedded into it...
2013-07-03 08:03:40	zendeavor	[04:01:58] keenerd: what wm doesn't
2013-07-03 08:03:40	Apsu	[04:01:59] Earnestea: Pretty sure you can do that...
2013-07-03 08:03:40	kevr	[04:02:06] it's like having VIM for a plain console.
2013-07-03 08:03:40	keenerd	[04:02:07] zendeavor: TWM.
2013-07-03 08:03:40	Earnestea	[04:02:09] Apsu: I was prett sure too
2013-07-03 08:03:40	kevr	[04:02:10] and the configuration is so easy..
2013-07-03 08:03:40	keenerd	[04:02:22] zendeavor: No ambitions, no problems!

2013-07-03 08:03:40	endiruna	[04:02:51] zendeavor, never understood that. seems on further step. better let the wm do it no?
2013-07-03 08:03:40	keenerd	[04:02:54] *real
2013-07-03 08:03:40	cinelli	[04:03:00] keenerd: fuckno
2013-07-03 08:03:40	cinelli	[04:03:11] keenerd: and I'm unbelievably pissed about it..
2013-07-03 08:03:40	Earnestea	[04:03:14] Apsu: You probably can, somehow, but by default or with EZConfig you cannot
2013-07-03 08:03:40	Earnestea	[04:03:31] Apsu: Because they use keysymdef.h
2013-07-03 08:03:40	keenerd	[04:03:32] cinelli: What about Pierre?
2013-07-03 08:03:40	zendeavor	[04:03:35] endiruna: until the automagic layout does something you don't like and you have to manually reconfigure it
2013-07-03 08:03:40	cinelli	[04:03:54] keenerd: now i'm waiting for a third party assurer from CAcert, and then have to goto a notary, then have to mail all the documents to Australia and Germany and then 6 - 10 weeks will get a response
2013-07-03 08:03:40	Apsu	[04:04:02] endiruna: i3 isn't a "manual" tiler. subtle is a manual tiler. i3 is an automatic tiler, just like xmonad. It just doesn't have as many automatic tiling modes or flexibility as xmonad.
2013-07-03 08:03:40	cinelli	[04:04:14] keenerd: sent him 4 emails, maid sure my client setup is just how he needs it.. so it doesn't just reject my emails
2013-07-03 08:03:40	cinelli	[04:04:18] keenerd: fucking bullshit brother
2013-07-03 08:03:40	cinelli	[04:04:36] keenerd: Seeing as there are plenty of TUs/devs that are signed by everyone and most don't have Cacert...

2013-07-03 11:51:11	zendeavor	the script is on your system in /usr/bin
2013-07-03 11:51:21	zendeavor	you see it starts with set -e, then pulseaudio --start "$@"
2013-07-03 11:51:41	zendeavor	pulseaudio --start runs as a daemon and automagically detaches itself from the script
2013-07-03 11:51:49	zendeavor	because it's a daemon and daemons do horrible things like that
2013-07-03 11:52:12	zendeavor	so everything AFTER that should be meaningless, since pulseaudio --start actually does work.
2013-07-03 11:52:20	Apsu	You'd sure think so -- but apparently it's not working for you.

2013-07-03 11:54:34	Apsu	... huh.
2013-07-03 11:54:50	Apsu	Yet --start says "pulseaudio is guaranteed to be fully initialized when this call returns" in the manpage.

2013-07-03 12:45:23	Gyndawyr	how do I know if it is resolving an IP address?

2013-07-03 12:45:44	NoXzema	Yeah, if you really can't figure out how to get internet working on that specific computer, just copy a wicd package onto there and let it do the work.
2013-07-03 12:45:56	Mad_Hatter_93	if you're connected, A) your ping will work, and B) ip link show enp3s0 will show an IP address

2013-07-03 13:28:51	nuckrophilia	And I don't wanna have to manually configure that shit
2013-07-03 13:28:52	Mad_Hatter_93	because without dialog you can't use the curses interface and it throws the whole thing under the bus
2013-07-03 13:29:04	sheep	nuckrophilia, why don't they just use one network with one SSID?
2013-07-03 13:29:17	Mad_Hatter_93	nuckrophilia: Exactly. I hop back and forth between at least 4 networks regularly, and fuck thart

2013-07-03 13:29:33	nuckrophilia	sheep: I wish I knew.  I think it's because some departments have their own wifi networks due to the schoolwide network having shitty coverage in their buildings
2013-07-03 13:29:41	nuckrophilia	So we get like CMPSC_WIFI001

2013-07-03 13:30:31	sheep	computer science and IT are (supposed to be) two different things but both lack common sense

2013-07-03 13:30:54	Gyndawyr	It's a "tempa" wireless card. Never heard of it. it was cheap.

2013-07-03 13:31:42	Mad_Hatter_93	Gyndawyr: Still, wicd will be easy and intuitive to set up and maintain
2013-07-03 13:31:48	nuckrophilia	Mad_Hatter_93: It's Windows, no case-sensitivity
2013-07-03 13:32:04	Mad_Hatter_93	nuckrophilia: But I don't want people lumping in stupid DWM with my lovely dwm
2013-07-03 13:32:10	shape	Gyndawyr: and you can use wpa supplicant for that, or like Mad_Hatter_93 suggested, wicd which is super intuitive, even if u get wicd-gtk for interface
2013-07-03 13:32:14	Gyndawyr	I followed the guide but I messed it up and so I have no idea what will have worked and what won't
2013-07-03 13:32:38	Mad_Hatter_93	shape: Haha, wpa_supplicant is fun, but a nightmare for first timer noobs like when I started with arch
2013-07-03 13:32:46	nuckrophilia	Well
2013-07-03 13:32:50	nuckrophilia	wicd just uses wpa_supplicant
2013-07-03 13:32:51	Gyndawyr	I want to get enlightenment window manager :P
