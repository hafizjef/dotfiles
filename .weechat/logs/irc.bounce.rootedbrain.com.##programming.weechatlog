2013-06-25 15:13:40	Tynach	I have a bit of a strange question. I had posted some advice to Reddit a while back, and got a fairly negative response. When I asked why it was bad advice, I didn't get very many answers. This doesn't usually bug me, but I really would like to know what I'm wrong about, so that I can learn.. Is it OK for me to post a link to what I said here, is this even the right place to ask, and if it is but I shouldn't link, should I just talk
2013-06-25 15:13:42	Tynach	about what I said in vague terms?
2013-06-25 15:14:04	Tynach	It was advice about what programming languages to learn.
2013-06-25 15:14:20	Rounin	Ah, haha... In that case, I think I can tell you without seeing it :D

2013-06-25 15:14:49	Rounin	So of course you're going to be downvoted
2013-06-25 15:15:04	Tynach	Well, I advocated both for and against the languages, and I tried to be kinda unbiased with it.
2013-06-25 15:15:08	Rounin	I just tell people to learn'em all, but start with Python if you don't have nay other ideas

2013-06-25 15:16:07	Tynach	The person wanted to make an Android app, and asked if he should start with Java or Python. I mentioned that Python is easier to start with, and doesn't have restrictions (like, Python has operator overloading, Java does not), but I did mention that since Java kinda forces you into OOP, it can be a great learning language for how to properly structure things.

2013-06-25 15:17:52	Tynach	And then someone said that if any advice in the thread was bad enough not to follow, mine was it. And his was upvoted quite high and not really downvoted. So I thought maybe my reasoning was wrong; since so many people agreed with him.

2013-06-25 15:19:14	+Kelet	Probably because the Android ecosystem is heavily invested in Java, and Python isn't used much in Android development. Most people would prefer to learn something they'll be working with.

2013-06-25 15:19:55	-->	d3pwnd (~d3pwnd@213.61.212.86) has joined ##programming
2013-06-25 15:20:01	Tynach	And also, two thirds of my post was dedicated to talking about why Java is such a great programming language to learn.
2013-06-25 15:20:08	+Kelet	Most people know that you program Android phones primarily using Java
2013-06-25 15:20:38	+Kelet	If he was to start programming Python and learning it for months only to find out he has little options when programming his phone (the end goal) he might be a little disapointed.
2013-06-25 15:20:57	Tynach	I agree.
2013-06-25 15:21:02	Tynach	My TL;DR was "Go ahead and learn Java. But really, Python is a great language that you should really look into."
2013-06-25 15:21:07	+Kelet	Your post probably should have went something like "Python is a great language for learning <reasoning>, but Java is what's used in the Android ecosphere"
2013-06-25 15:21:24	+Kelet	Or maybe it did, I don't have it to reference
2013-06-25 15:21:39	Tynach	That's kinda why my initial question was if it was OK for me to link it here.
2013-06-25 15:21:52	+Kelet	It sounds like a dumb question to me anyway
2013-06-25 15:22:07	+Kelet	I have a copy-paste response to those kind of threads but it ends up being downvoted usually
2013-06-25 15:22:14	Tynach	Heh.
2013-06-25 15:22:15	+Kelet	So I stopped posting it
2013-06-25 15:22:21	Tynach	I can see why.
2013-06-25 15:23:00	+Kelet	And often times I'll post an in-depth technical explanation that took me hours to write, it gets 2-3 upvotes. I write some witty one-liner and get 200-300. Reddit upvotes are trash for determining what is quality.
2013-06-25 15:23:12	Tynach	The highest rated answer is, "If you want to make games, go with Unity3D and learn C#. You can port to Android from there."
2013-06-25 15:23:16	Tynach	Paraphrased.

2013-06-25 20:54:52	+Engen	[15:53:24] psyk: ask your question, someone might know and answer.
2013-06-25 20:54:52	+psyk	[15:56:24] Engen: sure I'll try
2013-06-25 20:54:52	+psyk	[15:56:30] TakumoKatekari: why is that?
2013-06-25 20:54:52	+psyk	[15:57:02] Basically, I have 700 Excel files with identical structure (ie. tables) and I want to be able to iterate through each one of them, grab some of the tables' values, sum them up and then finally write them to my Access DB. I've written this set of operations in talend and I need some help knowing where the problem is
2013-06-25 20:54:52	BobBaluba	[15:57:38] anyone here ever tried using sencha touch (minified with sencha cmd) and websydian express together?
2013-06-25 20:54:52	+TakumoKatekari	[15:57:39] Right, first of I see three major issues: Excel is not tables, Access isn't a DB and Talend is your problem.
2013-06-25 20:54:52	+TakumoKatekari	[15:58:14] Other than that, is there a reason you're not using macros and VB script to do it?
2013-06-25 20:54:52	+skeuomorf	[15:58:47] BobBaluba: no, but I made a project using jquery mobile
2013-06-25 20:54:52	+psyk	[15:59:20] TakumoKatekari no need for that, I'm sure you know what I mean. The reason is I don't know how to add things to a database with VB scripts
2013-06-25 20:54:52	+TakumoKatekari	[15:59:57] psyk: You'd find a lot more support is available for VB scripts, and the process much simpler than using Talend.
2013-06-25 20:54:52	+TakumoKatekari	[16:00:16] I doubt you'll find much help for Talend, being the beast that it is.
2013-06-25 20:54:52	+psyk	[16:02:53] Right. If I don't solve it I guess I could use marcos and VB scripts for the manipulation of the files and talend for the actual writing to the (mysql) DB
2013-06-25 20:54:52	+psyk	[16:03:15] Reason for Talend is that I was handed a project already halfly complete and it was built on Talend
2013-06-25 20:54:52	+TakumoKatekari	[16:03:52] psyk: I feel so sorry for yo
2013-06-25 20:54:52	BobBaluba	[16:04:39] skeuomorf: jquery mobile with websydian express?
2013-06-25 20:54:52	+skeuomorf	[16:05:53] BobBaluba: no, the stack was as follows: HTML + jquerymobile > jquery > json > php
2013-06-25 20:54:52	+psyk	[16:05:54] TakumoKatekari: Is that really so? any reason in particular that it's no good? Except that is lacks some functionality it seems pretty straightforward to me (until now I guess)
2013-06-25 20:54:52	+skeuomorf	[16:06:11] BobBaluba: ugly stack BTW, I advise against it
2013-06-25 20:54:52	+skeuomorf	[16:06:17] also, never use PHP
2013-06-25 20:54:52	+TakumoKatekari	[16:09:18] psyk: Tools like Talend seem like they'd be great, but actually never quite work out at the end. You're almost always best of writing actual code.
2013-06-25 20:54:52	BobBaluba	[16:12:20] skeuomorf: meh, back to the drawing board. i WILL tame the sencha cmd/touch + websydian monster!
2013-06-25 20:54:52	+skeuomorf	[16:14:42] BobBaluba: what are you trying to accomplish?
2013-06-25 20:54:52	BobBaluba	[16:24:14] skeuomorf: trying to get the project to work from bacicly any browser. Works flawless before the code is minified (but too slow loading). Won't load the js-files after minifying.
2013-06-25 20:54:52	+skeuomorf	[16:27:02] BobBaluba: oh, so you already completed the project, hmm
2013-06-25 20:54:52	+skeuomorf	[16:27:34] BobBaluba: maybe it's a common issue, check stackoverflow, the framework's issues or similar stuff
2013-06-25 20:54:52	BobBaluba	[16:30:14] skeuomorf: more or less. the problem seems to be with paths to the js-files. the webserver requires me to change the generated files to include the correct path, and after the correct path is entered, all I get is a gray page
2013-06-25 20:54:52	+skeuomorf	[16:36:19] BobBaluba: try a JS channel or webdev channel
2013-06-25 20:54:52	+skeuomorf	[16:36:34] you'll probably find guys who use the same frameworks that you use there
2013-06-25 20:54:52	Kadmos	[16:36:56] Hello Dudes
2013-06-25 20:54:52	BobBaluba	[16:36:56] skeuomorf: will do
2013-06-25 20:54:52	Kadmos	[16:38:36] i have developed an application using WPF and a server that hosts web service. Writes to database are very fast and generally database /services have good performance even on slow pc With ATOM cpu and gma with 5400 hard disk.
2013-06-25 20:54:52	Kadmos	[16:39:06] However WPF application runs fine without lag at low end cards but no at very low end such Intel GMA etc
2013-06-25 20:54:52	Kadmos	[16:39:42] i have a lag there with ATOM cpu and i cant beat it. Is there any other good performing UI framework to use that is easy and allows custom graphics?

2013-06-25 21:36:47	Rounin	Mm... I've had this same assignment once... Although with Java instead of VB... The idea is to make a program that accepts user input and stores the input in an array or a collection of some type
2013-06-25 21:37:01	Rounin	And as _jgr says, it does some basic math to come up with some aggregate numbers

2013-06-27 02:47:44	mitch907	wrong button
2013-06-27 02:48:47	mitch907	Anyway, about Chad Barraford and his Digital Life Assistant. So I pretty much copied his idea, all the way down to using applescript. My question is now that I have created this thing in applescript what would be the easiest language to port it to?

2013-06-27 02:50:09	mitch907	I do understand that applescript is not what most would call a programing language so please dont go down that road. I am trying to figure out a way to make this into an actual program rather than just voice executing a ton of applescripts
2013-06-27 02:50:22	mitch907	Currently I am running this setup on a mac mini
2013-06-27 02:50:34	mitch907	Idealy this could be run on a Pi or arduino
2013-06-27 02:51:24	mitch907	I plan to use the kinect as the sensors for the system.
2013-06-27 02:51:32	BlackMoons	mitch907: Angelscript was based around C++
2013-06-27 02:51:44	BlackMoons	So its likey to be easiest to port to C++
2013-06-27 02:51:47	BlackMoons	*maybe* java.

2013-06-27 02:57:04	BlackMoons	Sadly yes.
2013-06-27 02:57:22	BlackMoons	since he didn't ask for 'best' or 'fastest' or 'secure' or 'may be around in 5 years'
2013-06-27 02:57:23	+AngelFish-	Although python would be easier, it has fairly significant platform-specific issues.

2013-06-27 02:58:58	+Znoosey	cool
2013-06-27 02:59:00	BlackMoons	...
2013-06-27 02:59:05	BlackMoons	Get a voice recognition API
2013-06-27 02:59:09	mitch907	is that a problem?
2013-06-27 02:59:10	BlackMoons	don't code that stuff yourself..
2013-06-27 02:59:15	+Znoosey	there are good ones for java?
2013-06-27 02:59:36	+Znoosey	cause the ones i have found are unusable if you have a slight accent of any kind
2013-06-27 02:59:42	BlackMoons	voice recognition = stupidly complex, master coders have been working on it for decades just trying to get it to work with basic speech
2013-06-27 02:59:48	mitch907	no no I will be doing this the most efficient way possible. Like I said before its more of a learning experience than anything else
2013-06-27 02:59:48	+AngelFish-	Audio processing is one of those things that you're advised not to touch if you don't understand it.

2013-06-27 03:00:47	+Znoosey	mitch907, go find a library for voice recognition, then couple that with apaches opennlp or something

2013-06-27 03:01:15	BlackMoons	Case in point: I once said "Hello how are you" the voice recongition software wrote "the cow jumped over the moon"
2013-06-27 03:01:22	+Znoosey	and you will start getting close to something that works

2013-06-27 03:01:31	BlackMoons	that was one of its better results...
2013-06-27 03:01:31	mitch907	Will it be less reliable than in applescript? I ask because of right now I use applescript and it is pretty accurate with voice recognition. I am currently using Nuance speach engine for processing the voice requests so would that make a difference?

2013-06-27 03:02:22	BlackMoons	mitch907: depends on your exact voice processing engine, your accent, your speech pattrens, level of frustration/drunkeness, etc.
2013-06-27 03:02:45	BlackMoons	never talk to a voice recongition engine while really mad. it will only piss you off more
2013-06-27 03:02:46	+Znoosey	but they have quite a few layers of code on top of that engine to make it usable

2013-06-27 03:04:07	mitch907	So is there anyway I can use my current speach engine? I am using nuance dragon speaks and that listens for a keyword "jarvis" lets say and from there it listens for the command keyword which tells it what applescript to run.
2013-06-27 03:04:22	+AngelFish-	Java can interface with the operating system
2013-06-27 03:04:45	+AngelFish-	However, a pi or an arduino would not have the engine
2013-06-27 03:04:51	+AngelFish-	So you'd need to find something else.
2013-06-27 03:04:58	mitch907	Ok so java will just be taking the place of my current applescripts
2013-06-27 03:05:18	+AngelFish-	Pretty much.
2013-06-27 03:05:25	mitch907	but if I were to reprogram it in java replacing the current speach engine should be much simplier shouldnt it be?

2013-06-27 03:06:24	+Znoosey	it will only cause you grief

2013-06-27 03:07:44	mitch907	Yeah like i said I wont be writing the speach engine myself until I feel WAY more comfortable with the language if even then. I am really just using this project as an excuse to force myself into dipping my toes into the programming pool.
2013-06-27 03:07:49	+AngelFish-	There really isn't a good, cross platform speech recognition engine to the best of my knowledge.
2013-06-27 03:07:58	BlackMoons	^^
2013-06-27 03:08:04	+AngelFish-	I mean, aside from web-based services
2013-06-27 03:08:11	+AngelFish-	Which can be remarkably decent.

2013-06-27 03:11:35	Amadiro	And latency and battery usage is probably still worse than processing it locally

2013-06-27 03:16:49	mitch907	but now I would like to implement the kinect into this so it knows where I am in the room and if other ppl are with me. But I figured if i do that then I might as well try to roll this all into one neat program.
2013-06-27 03:17:16	+Znoosey	mitch907, get the kinect part right first
2013-06-27 03:17:27	+Znoosey	then keep looking for "speech to text" programs
2013-06-27 03:17:48	+Znoosey	 sooner or later there will be a good one coming up
2013-06-27 03:18:01	mitch907	Thats the thing Dragon speaks isnt compatable with the kinect
2013-06-27 03:18:23	+Znoosey	mitch907, make one thing at a time
2013-06-27 03:18:37	mitch907	what do you mean?
2013-06-27 03:18:42	mr_pinc	Angelfish: yeah I tried win merge, it seemd to provide a list of differences but I did not see anything for exporting them
2013-06-27 03:18:43	+Znoosey	make a program for your mac that does the kinect thing
2013-06-27 03:18:56	+Znoosey	and just keep the applescripts running
2013-06-27 03:19:28	+Znoosey	then when you got a version for kinect that works you can start working on the speech to text part
