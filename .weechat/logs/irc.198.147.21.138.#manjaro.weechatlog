2013-06-23 03:46:25	aguitel	[22:12:36] i make this with ubuntu 12.04
2013-06-23 03:46:25	@ringo32	[22:13:24] that can if ubuntu has the grub then is can probably only dont use the live-installer :)
2013-06-23 03:46:25	@ringo32	[22:13:38] thats more MBR related
2013-06-23 03:46:25	@ringo32	[22:14:41] look at this basic https://vimeo.com/51098122      further i dont know gater some info on forum too
2013-06-23 03:46:25	@ringo32	[22:14:55] yfdogan does dualboot with win8 but further? i dont know
2013-06-23 03:46:25	aguitel	[22:15:41] ok
2013-06-23 03:46:25	Reihar	[22:21:57] ringo32: I'm on a live cd
2013-06-23 03:46:25	Reihar	[22:22:14] I think I'm just going to reinstall while keeping the /home intact
2013-06-23 03:46:25	Reihar	[22:22:19] and recreating the users after
2013-06-23 03:46:25	Reihar	[22:22:56] ringo32: that should be the fastest way to solve that
2013-06-23 03:46:25	@ringo32	[22:25:22] 0.86?
2013-06-23 03:46:25	Reihar	[22:27:06] ringo32: I guess
2013-06-23 03:46:25	Reihar	[22:27:09] the latest stable
2013-06-23 03:46:25	Reihar	[22:27:23] the one on the download page with the graphical installer
2013-06-23 03:46:25	Reihar	[22:27:44] Yeah
2013-06-23 03:46:25	Reihar	[22:27:52] 0.86 indeed.
2013-06-23 03:46:25	@ringo32	[22:28:48] then ok, you get the /sbin thing but normal is just sudo pacman -Syu
2013-06-23 03:46:25	@ringo32	[22:29:00] you came from 0.84
2013-06-23 03:46:25	@ringo32	[22:29:13] so there is 3 a 4 issues farther if i remember
2013-06-23 03:46:25	@ringo32	[22:29:38] 0.86 knows the sbin and the renaming of bluez
2013-06-23 03:46:25	@ringo32	[22:29:51] on mate editions could bring issues
2013-06-23 03:46:25	Reihar	[22:30:15] I'm going to take a cinnamon/gnome3 0.86
2013-06-23 03:46:25	@ringo32	[22:39:16] xfce is also better
2013-06-23 03:46:25	@ringo32	[22:39:19] :)
2013-06-23 03:46:25	Reihar	[22:39:39] ringo32: I know
2013-06-23 03:46:25	Reihar	[22:39:57] Gnome 3 is just better if you've never touched a computer in your whole life
2013-06-23 03:46:25	Reihar	[22:40:14] or if your level is so abyssal that you need something terribly simple
2013-06-23 03:46:25	@ringo32	[22:40:30] get crazy of gnome =:)
2013-06-23 03:46:25	@ringo32	[22:41:30] i have just xfce is just simple for me and dont eats too much resources :) and have whisker menu on it so such menu is nice
2013-06-23 03:46:25	Reihar	[22:42:20] ringo32: Well, I'm a big fan of xfce.
2013-06-23 03:46:25	Reihar	[22:42:27] But that desktop is not mine.
2013-06-23 03:46:25	Reihar	[22:42:43] I'm just doing maintenance.
2013-06-23 03:46:25	Reihar	[22:43:25] Currently, I roll with Subtle on my pc.
2013-06-23 03:46:25	@ringo32	[22:43:48] well its yours :) cinnamon its ok, i dont know what happend when rolling ro 2.0
2013-06-23 03:46:25	@ringo32	[22:43:51] to
2013-06-23 03:46:25	Reihar	[22:45:26] Btw, something I love with arch and cinnamon is the fact that their isos are ddifiable.
2013-06-23 03:46:25	Reihar	[22:45:45] And yes, this is now a word.
2013-06-23 03:46:25	@ringo32	[22:45:57] on somepart manjaro and arch differs a lot
2013-06-23 03:46:25	Reihar	[22:46:06] like ?
2013-06-23 03:46:25	@ringo32	[22:46:26] i dont know never used arch :p
2013-06-23 03:46:25	@ringo32	[22:46:52] i talked someting too much :p
2013-06-23 03:46:25	@ringo32	[22:46:59] sometimes
2013-06-23 03:46:25	Reihar	[22:47:09] Well, I guess
2013-06-23 03:46:25	@ringo32	[22:47:24] is still arch but what differs i dont know
2013-06-23 03:46:25	@ringo32	[22:47:30] mayby a little
2013-06-23 03:46:25	Reihar	[22:47:35] there's the manjaro file system package for example
2013-06-23 03:46:25	@ringo32	[22:47:59] people that comes on arch does something when new people comes on manjaro
2013-06-23 03:46:25	@ringo32	[23:04:24] :p
2013-06-23 03:46:25	@ringo32	[23:18:20] Reihar hi?
2013-06-23 03:46:25	@ringo32	[23:30:16] all alone :)

2013-06-23 04:21:44	Xeon3D	edge226: because it's Arch really.
2013-06-23 04:22:25	Xeon3D	Updates come quicker than Manjaro, it has less mods than Manjaro (when comparing to Arch).
2013-06-23 04:22:56	Xeon3D	Having said that, it's also more easily broken than Manjaro. :)
2013-06-23 04:23:48	Xeon3D	And it has a crappier community than Manjaro too :P #antergos has like 6 people myself included and the wiki is non-existant (but then again, arch wiki works perfectly for it)

2013-06-23 04:24:47	edge226	Xeon3D, To me it being more pure arch is less of a reason to use it, I hated all the random breakages.
2013-06-23 04:25:45	Xeon3D	Well tbh, I haven't broken it yet and I went thru most of the "hard" changes appeared without a reinstall like the /bin thingy amongst others.
