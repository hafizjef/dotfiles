2013-06-27 01:29:57	+diminoten	[21:11:47] ahhh!  my old calc teacher just added me on facebook!
2013-06-27 01:29:57	+diminoten	[21:11:55] woo
2013-06-27 01:29:57	+Znoosey	[21:13:13] diminoten, can you ask him what 1-matrix(any matrix really) means? :P
2013-06-27 01:29:57	+diminoten	[21:13:24] lol
2013-06-27 01:29:57	+Znoosey	[21:13:33] i can't find anything on google
2013-06-27 01:29:57	+diminoten	[21:13:54] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)
2013-06-27 01:29:57	+Znoosey	[21:15:00] diminoten, yeah have looked at that
2013-06-27 01:29:57	+diminoten	[21:15:08] whats the context
2013-06-27 01:29:57	Amadiro	[21:15:28] "1-matrix" sounds like an unusual way to say "1x1 matrix" which is an unusual way to say "scalar"
2013-06-27 01:29:57	inf-groupoid	[21:15:44] Is there any portable way to get the addresses at which the lowest and highest n bits of a uint(2n)_t (from <inttypes.h>) are located?
2013-06-27 01:29:57	+Znoosey	[21:15:45] neural network error propagation function
2013-06-27 01:29:57	+Znoosey	[21:16:13] Amadiro, yes... but how do i subtract that from a different matrix?
2013-06-27 01:29:57	Amadiro	[21:16:26] Znoosey, the normal way, its just scalars
2013-06-27 01:29:57	+vendu	[21:16:32] inf-groupoid, umm what addresses? :)
2013-06-27 01:29:57	inf-groupoid	[21:16:38] Znoosey: Matrix subtraction is simply subtracting corresponding elements.
2013-06-27 01:29:57	+vendu	[21:16:46] inf-groupoid, reformulate the question ;)
2013-06-27 01:29:57	+Znoosey	[21:17:01] inf-groupoid, yes i know... that is why i got confused with this notations
2013-06-27 01:29:57	+Znoosey	[21:17:04] -s
2013-06-27 01:29:57	inf-groupoid	[21:17:36] vendu: Say I have a uint32_t variable. It must be stored somewhere. I want to get the addresses of the lowest and highest 16 bits, so that I can use them as (uint16_t*)s.
2013-06-27 01:29:57	+Znoosey	[21:17:55] first i thought my notes was wrong, and it was supposed to be I, but then i do not have a square matrix to subtract from all the time... so that is sort of a loss
2013-06-27 01:29:57	inf-groupoid	[21:18:01] vendu: In a portable way, of course, because I hate conditional compilation.
2013-06-27 01:29:57	rindolf	[21:18:27] inf-groupoid: sizeof?
2013-06-27 01:29:57	inf-groupoid	[21:19:28] rindolf: How would sizeof help?
2013-06-27 01:29:57	Amadiro	[21:19:43] inf-groupoid, do you want something that is merely portable, or something that follows the standard to the letter
2013-06-27 01:29:57	inf-groupoid	[21:20:05] Amadiro: Well, the latter would be desirable, but I can settle for the former.
2013-06-27 01:29:57	Amadiro	[21:20:33] inf-groupoid, I'm not sure about the latter, for the former a union would probably work, because I think the standard only allows padding next to the highest bits.
2013-06-27 01:29:57	+vendu	[21:20:44] inf-groupoid, access the values with a pointer to something like struct val32 { int16_t int0; int16_t int1 };
2013-06-27 01:29:57	+vendu	[21:21:00] sorry, i0 and i1 :)
2013-06-27 01:29:57	+vendu	[21:21:02] is more compact
2013-06-27 01:29:57	inf-groupoid	[21:21:15] vendu: But then I would have to reinvent how to multiply val32s from scratch.
2013-06-27 01:29:57	inf-groupoid	[21:21:24] s/multiply/perform arithmetic operations/
2013-06-27 01:29:57	+vendu	[21:21:47] inf-groupoid, yeah, well, why cannot you use int16_t?
2013-06-27 01:29:57	Amadiro	[21:21:57] vendus suggestion may work in gcc and such if you __attribute__((packed))
2013-06-27 01:29:57	Amadiro	[21:22:18] otherwise padding may be between them
2013-06-27 01:29:57	+vendu	[21:22:20] yep, you want to pack the structure as amadiro said
2013-06-27 01:29:57	Amadiro	[21:22:36] actually, the union may require a packed attribute as well, I'm not entirely sure
2013-06-27 01:29:57	iveqy	[21:22:40] when using cockoo hashing and insert an element that results in a cycle, the correct thing to do is to rebuild the hashtable with an other function. How can we prove that the rebuild will end up with an open place?
2013-06-27 01:29:57	inf-groupoid	[21:22:42] Mmm...
2013-06-27 01:29:57	+vendu	[21:23:08] inf-groupoid, _why_ not int16_t? ;)
2013-06-27 01:29:57	inf-groupoid	[21:24:51] vendu: What I want to do is reduce the amount of boilerplate here - http://ideone.com/YnjL2z - I figured if I could explicitly manipulate the highest and lowest 16 bits of a uint32_t, and similarly, the highest and lowest 32 bits of a uint64_t, I could reduce the boilerplate by defining the decoders for uint32_ts and uint64_ts in terms of the decoders for uint16_ts and uint32_ts, respectively.
2013-06-27 01:29:57	troker	[21:25:07] Hey all, Im a real new user to ML (using SciPy) and Im a bit stuck currently.  I have an array of data that looks like this (one entry into the array) - http://fpaste.org/21103/
2013-06-27 01:29:57	troker	[21:25:08] Im looking to "compare the row vectors of V using a similarity measure, such as the cosine similarity" (Im attempting to emulate the work in this paper http://user.informatik.uni-goettingen.de/~krieck/docs/2011-woot.pdf)  -- Any thoughts on how I might go about doing that?  Is scipy.spatial.distance.cosine the best way to do this?
2013-06-27 01:29:57	+Rounin	[21:26:19] iveqy: Can you prove that? Suppose your first hash places elements in position 1, 3, 7 and 8... Your new hash function places them in 8, 7, 3 and 1... Different mapping, but occupying the same positions
2013-06-27 01:29:57	+Rounin	[21:26:41] It seems like you'd have to pick a special hash function to have that guarantee
2013-06-27 01:29:57	inf-groupoid	[21:26:43] vendu: std::(u)int(16/32/64)_t are the same as the non-std::-qualified versions from <inttypes.h> in the C standard library.
2013-06-27 01:29:57	inf-groupoid	[21:27:32] I posted it in C++ because I have no idea how to portably printf() a (u)int(16/32/64)_t.
2013-06-27 01:29:57	+vendu	[21:28:00] inf-groupoid, i'd have macros for subparts of those functions, but of course in c :)
2013-06-27 01:29:57	iveqy	[21:28:12] Rounin: precisely. So I can't see how cockoo hashing actually can be used in real world applications
2013-06-27 01:29:57	inf-groupoid	[21:30:30] vendu: Mmm... And those macros would be conditionally compiled, right?
2013-06-27 01:29:57	inf-groupoid	[21:30:46] I mean, for the sake of portability across machines with different endianness.

2013-06-27 03:02:46	+Znoosey	but they have quite a few layers of code on top of that engine to make it usable

2013-06-27 03:04:07	mitch907	So is there anyway I can use my current speach engine? I am using nuance dragon speaks and that listens for a keyword "jarvis" lets say and from there it listens for the command keyword which tells it what applescript to run.
2013-06-27 03:04:22	+AngelFish-	Java can interface with the operating system
2013-06-27 03:04:45	+AngelFish-	However, a pi or an arduino would not have the engine
2013-06-27 03:04:51	+AngelFish-	So you'd need to find something else.
2013-06-27 03:04:58	mitch907	Ok so java will just be taking the place of my current applescripts
2013-06-27 03:05:18	+AngelFish-	Pretty much.
2013-06-27 03:05:25	mitch907	but if I were to reprogram it in java replacing the current speach engine should be much simplier shouldnt it be?

2013-06-27 03:06:13	+Znoosey	mitch907, find a speech engine that already exists... don't even bother trying to write it yourself
2013-06-27 03:06:24	+Znoosey	it will only cause you grief
2013-06-27 03:06:51	BlackMoons	mitch907: you might be able to find ways to use your current speech engine while on apple

2013-06-27 03:07:40	BlackMoons	(you did ask for 'universal'
2013-06-27 03:07:44	mitch907	Yeah like i said I wont be writing the speach engine myself until I feel WAY more comfortable with the language if even then. I am really just using this project as an excuse to force myself into dipping my toes into the programming pool.
2013-06-27 03:07:49	+AngelFish-	There really isn't a good, cross platform speech recognition engine to the best of my knowledge.
2013-06-27 03:07:58	BlackMoons	^^
2013-06-27 03:08:04	+AngelFish-	I mean, aside from web-based services
2013-06-27 03:08:11	+AngelFish-	Which can be remarkably decent.
2013-06-27 03:08:11	BlackMoons	mitch907: Might I recommend you state what OS'es you are targeting?
2013-06-27 03:08:34	BlackMoons	'just <x>' makes things simpler. a lot simpler

2013-06-27 03:09:55	mitch907	Would it make more sense to run the speech engine on a central server and have other devices connect to the server thus nulling the cross platform speech engine problem?

2013-06-27 03:11:03	+AngelFish-	Android Java isn't really Java
2013-06-27 03:11:03	+Znoosey	yeah BlackMoons it almost supports java
2013-06-27 03:11:13	Amadiro	but it critically depends on you being able to provide the bandwidth and scalability
2013-06-27 03:11:13	BlackMoons	Znoosey: k.
2013-06-27 03:11:35	Amadiro	And latency and battery usage is probably still worse than processing it locally
2013-06-27 03:11:42	mitch907	How much bandwidth could I need? It will only be a program for myself...
2013-06-27 03:11:43	+AngelFish-	Or you can pay someone who has the bandwidth and scalability.
2013-06-27 03:11:53	+AngelFish-	Wolfram comes to mind.
2013-06-27 03:11:56	Amadiro	mitch907, oh, well then.
2013-06-27 03:12:08	+Znoosey	afaik dalvik is close to identical to java though, so you will be hard pressed to find java code that wont work on android

2013-06-27 03:17:16	+Znoosey	mitch907, get the kinect part right first

2013-06-27 03:18:23	+Znoosey	mitch907, make one thing at a time

2013-06-27 03:18:56	+Znoosey	and just keep the applescripts running
2013-06-27 03:19:28	+Znoosey	then when you got a version for kinect that works you can start working on the speech to text part
