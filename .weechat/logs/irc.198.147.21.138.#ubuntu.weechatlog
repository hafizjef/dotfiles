2013-06-23 03:46:25	dsan	[23:26:08] compdoc, it had radeon driver (3.5 kernel), then I installed fglrx, but the desktop is still slow. do you have any suggestion to increase graphic card's performance?
2013-06-23 03:46:25	ofhs	[23:26:15] How do I reset my pulseaudio?
2013-06-23 03:46:25	wilee-nilee	[23:26:17] Guest14223, Good luck, you could go virtual in the mean time just to have the OS.
2013-06-23 03:46:25	kostkon	[23:26:20] ofhs, if you want to consider that option, then you'll need to delete your ~/.pulse folder, logout and log back in
2013-06-23 03:46:25	kostkon	[23:27:17] ofhs, are you on a laptop
2013-06-23 03:46:25	ofhs	[23:28:00] kostkon: Nope
2013-06-23 03:46:25	nintet	[23:28:40] here i am asking you guys about simple commands won't work on my system and i dont even have python installed
2013-06-23 03:46:25	kostkon	[23:28:43] ofhs, desktop with an onboard sound card, which i assume you havent disabled

2013-06-23 03:46:25	Slendermang	[23:29:00] Hi, could anyone help me out? I'm have a 2nd HDD that im trying to get it to automount. I cant set permissions on it for my other pcs to access files as I assume it is because of the fuseblk filesystem it has currently.
2013-06-23 03:46:25	nintet	[23:29:33] Slendermang, same exact problem here
2013-06-23 03:46:25	dsan	[23:29:42] is it correct command to remove unity on 12.10 "sudo apt-get remove unity unity-2d unity-2d-panel unity-2d-spread unity-asset-pool unity-services unity-lens-files unity-lens-music unity-lens-applications gir1.2-unity-5.0 unity-common indicator-sound indicator-power indicator-appmenu libindicator7 indicator-application indicator-datetime indicator-messages libnux-2.0-0 nux-tools libunity-misc4 unity-2d-common"

2013-06-23 03:46:25	dunhamds	[23:30:57] I downloaded a plugin for google audio and video calls but the bin file, whin I click on it, does nothing. Can anyone help make sense of this for a total n00b?
2013-06-23 03:46:25	reisio	[23:31:28] dunhamds: running from a terminal might yield more information
2013-06-23 03:46:25	crond	[23:31:49] dunhamds, chmod +x the plugin, then ./blah_plugin.bin from terminal
2013-06-23 03:46:25	dunhamds	[23:31:50] reisio.. I'm not even sure what that means :/
2013-06-23 03:46:25	Slendermang	[23:32:13] Reisio, I already have permissions to acess files/folders but I can't seem to give other usergroups permissions
2013-06-23 03:46:25	Slendermang	[23:32:45] The drive doesnt automatically mount on launch and such I dont think I can give other computers/usergroups permissions without having it do so
2013-06-23 03:46:25	Slendermang	[23:33:32] I was wondering on how the fstab should be propperly written for a 2nd drive as its kind of overwhelming for me, never used Linux prior
2013-06-23 03:46:25	ofhs	[23:34:06] kostkon: So is my best bet to try resetting my pulseaudio thing then?
2013-06-23 03:46:25	reisio	[23:34:13] Slendermang: same as first, only ending in 0 0
2013-06-23 03:46:25	Slendermang	[23:34:43] reisio, Ok I'll give that a try thanks :)

2013-06-23 04:58:13	Kelsey_Belsey	I've dealt with gimp, it's not as good as photoshop in my opinion.

2013-06-23 04:59:14	clue_h	Photoshop is good, i think linux distros are catching up with photoediting etc though. Have you tried inkscape
2013-06-23 04:59:24	clue_h	depends on what level of work you do

2013-06-23 05:06:23	holstein	[01:03:49] Kelsey_Belsey: photoshop is photoshop.. gimp is what folks use to do what you are mentioning.. try it.. its in the repos, and free of charge to try and use
2013-06-23 05:06:23	gordonjcp	[01:03:50] Kelsey_Belsey: there is a graphic editor calld gimp which has similar principles
2013-06-23 05:06:23	mchlbhm	[01:03:57] Movie player hung
2013-06-23 05:06:23	gordonjcp	[01:04:12] Kelsey_Belsey: there was a set of patches called "gimpshop" that tried to make the menus look like photoshop
2013-06-23 05:06:23	Kelsey_Belsey	[01:04:15] Well, I have used gimp in the past, then I upgraded to photoshop and never looked back.
2013-06-23 05:06:23	Kelsey_Belsey	[01:04:21] That would help a lot.
2013-06-23 05:06:23	gordonjcp	[01:04:26] that was a pretty stupid idea, and I think the project died
2013-06-23 05:06:23	Forty	[01:04:54] I'm running a bin file in the terminal and HPLIP setup ask me for the root's password. I put it and crash. Stop.
2013-06-23 05:06:23	Kelsey_Belsey	[01:06:01] Well, I heard from people that photoshop was better, and I think it is. But my knowledge of editing was very little when I had gimp and got better with photoshop.
2013-06-23 05:06:23	gordonjcp	[01:06:15] Kelsey_Belsey: for suitable values of "better"
2013-06-23 05:06:23	gordonjcp	[01:06:24] I prefer using gimp to photoshop because I don't know photoshop very well
2013-06-23 05:06:23	gordonjcp	[01:06:41] Kelsey_Belsey: frankly, if you want photoshop use photoshop, and buy a mac
2013-06-23 05:06:23	gordonjcp	[01:06:56] Kelsey_Belsey: there's no point going with anything else, if that's what you actually *need*

2013-06-23 05:06:28	clue_h	I started with photoshop a while back from version 4, then i moved to linux and tried gimp and found i could do alot still, but it took some time to learn
2013-06-23 05:06:47	Kelsey_Belsey	Well, I can get use to gimp again, it's not a problem.

2013-06-23 05:07:11	Wobbo	Any tips? 'AMD Catalyst Control Center (Administrative)' won't work. I am using 'amdxdg-su -c amdcccle' true terminal, then i get a new terminal minal asking for my password. Then it doesn't matter if I put a richt password or not, that terminal wont show any AMD Catalyst... I have used the logical way, 'sudo amdcccle' but that won't save any installations or anything.

2013-06-23 05:10:55	HeadcaseFargone	I'm looking to upgrade from 11.04 to 12.04 but am currently running a software RAID5 array and have read many users having issues with arrays not building properly after an upgrade.  I was wondering if I simply ran 12.04 from a USB stick to test this, is there any danger to the integrity of the data on that array?
2013-06-23 05:11:19	gordonjcp	HeadcaseFargone: not if you mount it read-only
2013-06-23 05:11:24	MonkeyDust	HeadcaseFargone  you would have to go via 12.10

2013-06-23 05:12:09	BlueEagle	HeadcaseFargone: The raid should not need to be rebuilt. It does however depend on how you have set up the raid. You do want to generate a raid configuration file so that you do not rely on the auto configuration.
2013-06-23 05:12:46	MonkeyDust	HeadcaseFargone  you cannot go directly from 11.04 to 12.04, or it must be a fresh install

2013-06-23 15:15:47	wheatthin	[10:53:12] wilee-nilee, what do you mean by dynamic?
2013-06-23 15:15:47	Dr_willis	[10:53:15] Holey Dynamic disks Batman!
2013-06-23 15:15:47	wheatthin	[10:54:09] hmm
2013-06-23 15:15:47	wilee-nilee	[10:54:35] wheatthin, It is a specialized partitioning that does not play with a dual boot of MS and linux and was caused probably by exceding the 4 primary partition limit or at least trying to.
2013-06-23 15:15:47	asdf__	[10:54:45] Well thank you for the help
2013-06-23 15:15:47	asdf__	[10:54:54] I appreciate it very much stranger
2013-06-23 15:15:47	wheatthin	[10:54:59] asdf__, I'd suggest reinstalling both windows and linux
2013-06-23 15:15:47	anonnumberanon	[10:54:59] asdf what is your problem right about now, and I assume you own a 2010 computer is that right? (300Gb drives + W7 is about 2008>2012)
2013-06-23 15:15:47	wilee-nilee	[10:55:01] lol Dr_willis
2013-06-23 15:15:47	wheatthin	[10:55:10] using none dynamic disk layout
2013-06-23 15:15:47	asdf__	[10:55:31] Yeah I'll probably do that
2013-06-23 15:15:47	asdf__	[10:55:39] Thank you again wheatthin
2013-06-23 15:15:47	wheatthin	[10:55:43] yup
2013-06-23 15:15:47	asdf__	[10:55:54] so I should factory restore right?
2013-06-23 15:15:47	wilee-nilee	[10:56:23] asdf__, It can be converted with the right tools back to what it was.
2013-06-23 15:15:47	wheatthin	[10:56:25] no.. if you have the windows installation disk, then I'd use linux to partition, then go install windows, and then ubuntu
2013-06-23 15:15:47	asdf__	[10:57:03] what do you mean by that
2013-06-23 15:15:47	mdev	[10:57:16] how do i let apache/php run as root wtih no pass
2013-06-23 15:15:47	wheatthin	[10:57:25] asdf__, well the restore disk might put the same layout
2013-06-23 15:15:47	asdf__	[10:58:19] And what do you mean byt using linux to partition, then windows, and then ubuntu
2013-06-23 15:15:47	asdf__	[10:58:28] Because I don't have any linux right now
2013-06-23 15:15:47	asdf__	[10:58:32] should I?
2013-06-23 15:15:47	wheatthin	[10:58:38] the livecd/dvd
2013-06-23 15:15:47	wheatthin	[10:58:59] using the terminal to partition with fdisk
2013-06-23 15:15:47	wheatthin	[10:59:09] set the size of ntfs partition you want
2013-06-23 15:15:47	wheatthin	[10:59:22] set the linux boot partition, swap, and root
2013-06-23 15:15:47	wheatthin	[11:00:11] then go install windows.. then boot the linux livecd/dvd and install ubuntu
2013-06-23 15:15:47	asdf__	[11:00:33] Isn't that Gpedit?
2013-06-23 15:15:47	asdf__	[11:00:37] or something like that?
2013-06-23 15:15:47	wheatthin	[11:00:46] gparted?
2013-06-23 15:15:47	asdf__	[11:00:55] gparted
2013-06-23 15:15:47	asdf__	[11:00:56] yeah
2013-06-23 15:15:47	wheatthin	[11:01:04] gedit is a text editor
2013-06-23 15:15:47	mdev	[11:01:09] how.do.I.run.php.as.root
2013-06-23 15:15:47	mdev	[11:01:19] under.ubuntu.
2013-06-23 15:15:47	wheatthin	[11:01:41] mdev, what do you mean run php as root?
2013-06-23 15:15:47	orman	[11:02:05] how can you bring a process to the foreground that root owns? for example jobs has no output, there is a process I want to bring back to the shell.
2013-06-23 15:15:47	wheatthin	[11:04:25] orman, have you tried looking for a log as a source of output?
2013-06-23 15:15:47	orman	[11:04:54] I've set it up that way, but for some reason the program does not work when scheduled
2013-06-23 15:15:47	orman	[11:05:04] vs being done in the shell
2013-06-23 15:15:47	wheatthin	[11:05:26] orman, did you set a cron job or something?
2013-06-23 15:15:47	wheatthin	[11:05:32] if so look in /var/log/syslog
2013-06-23 15:15:47	orman	[11:05:35] upstart .conf file

2013-06-23 15:49:22	anonnumberanon	when you install Ubuntu everything you do is made to be GUI-easy and you don't have to get into the workings of the packages to make them work. Having to read man pages is against that "new user" philosophy. If the marketing goal is to teach the user something, then more options for learning should be offered right off the bat.

For GNOME Fallback mode, which is similar to GNOME 2, install "gnome-panel". Both packages will place entries in the Sessions dropdown.

2013-06-27 02:52:57	ForSpareParts	I run XBMC on my HTPC pretty much all the time, and I have it installed on other boxes to stream content from the HTPC. Very slick. One of my roommates actually has XBMC on his Raspberry Pi, and he uses it the same way, as a sort of thin-client interface to the HTPC.

If I switch to a terminal only screen (ie ctrl-alt-F1) and start VLC with a local video file, it plays the file in the terminal doing its best with ascii characters. If I do the same thing in a terminal window... it spawns the VLC gui and plays the file in there... How can I force it to remain in the terminal I typed the command in ?
