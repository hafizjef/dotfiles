2013-06-27 05:59:25	+Amadiro	that's not very "abnormal", it's something every android or iOS developer should be aware of

2013-06-27 06:00:14	+AngelFish-	Well, those platforms don't give the end programmer nearly as much control as I have and those devices are much more likely to get regular charging.

2013-06-27 14:53:26	fierycatnet	[07:30:08] Engen, because I dont know how
2013-06-27 14:53:26	+Kelet	[07:30:25] fierycatnet, You need to pastebin some code on how you are extracting the data from the HTML I think
2013-06-27 14:53:26	+Engen	[07:31:28] fierycatnet: so in C you'd have printf ("%s:%s:%s\n", emailString, phoneString, addressString); so that everything is next to each other. why are you printing it vertically is the question. so, why vertical?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	+Kelet	[07:31:33] It's confusing because you suggest that you have the data in variables, but if you wanted to output the variables in aforementioned format, it's as simple as using string interpolation or concatenation with some semicolons -- like "#{email}:#{phone_number}:#{address}" and putting it in a file or wherever you need it.
2013-06-27 14:53:26	+Engen	[07:31:46] ^
2013-06-27 14:53:26	fierycatnet	[07:32:08] thats my code http://hastebin.com/favuhowaqa.rb
2013-06-27 14:53:26	+Kelet	[07:33:50] fierycatnet, The question is, are you sure that matching the 1st email to the 1st phone is correct?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	+Kelet	[07:33:58] or rather the nth email to the nth phone
2013-06-27 14:53:26	fierycatnet	[07:34:53] no its not, but its irrelevant right now because I am going to adjust it later, I just need an algorithm in ruby that can output data in a certain format
2013-06-27 14:53:26	+Kelet	[07:36:43] fierycatnet, There are a few ways you could do it, of note, you could loop with an index and then use that index to access all of the array's same element, for example       links.each_with_index { |link, index| puts "#{link}:#{email[i]}:#{phone[i]}" } or something
2013-06-27 14:53:26	+Kelet	[07:36:55] well change the i's to index
2013-06-27 14:53:26	fierycatnet	[07:38:07] ill look into it
2013-06-27 14:53:26	+Kelet	[07:39:21] fierycatnet, http://ideone.com/bMMtc4
2013-06-27 14:53:26	inf-groupoid	[07:39:35] What is the type safe alternative to plain wrong covariant arguments in OO languages?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	fierycatnet	[07:41:12] Kelet, oh, see I didnt know that. I am gonna try that. Has to work
2013-06-27 14:53:26	+Kelet	[07:42:03] fierycatnet, Alternatively, you could use a for loop like          for i in 0..(array.length-1)
2013-06-27 14:53:26	+Kelet	[07:42:18] But using each is seen as 'idiomatic' in ruby
2013-06-27 14:53:26	foolcool	[07:42:50] any1 here like project euler
2013-06-27 14:53:26	foolcool	[07:43:04] try problem 59 it's pretty hard
2013-06-27 14:53:26	fierycatnet	[07:43:51] either or, I just need this data formatted, I have to resort to this because apparently my company does not keep database or files on their clients, so I have to proccess this data throught a website....
2013-06-27 14:53:26	+Kelet	[07:46:32] It might be best to just scrape the data in some database and use that logic in your actual program
2013-06-27 14:53:26	+Kelet	[07:46:38] into some*
2013-06-27 14:53:26	fierycatnet	[07:47:19] no access to database =/
2013-06-27 14:53:26	norbu	[07:48:43] How can I get a C++ function to take in an arbitrary number of arguments?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	+Stryyker	[07:49:07] ...
2013-06-27 14:53:26	+Stryyker	[07:49:26] ##c++ knows a bit abot it
2013-06-27 14:53:26	BlackMoons	[07:50:20] YAY MY CODES WORKING :)
2013-06-27 14:53:26	BlackMoons	[07:50:32] Now to remove all this debuging reporting stuff -_-;
2013-06-27 14:53:26	BlackMoons	[07:50:55] And maybe split this 1240 line file up...
2013-06-27 14:53:26	fierycatnet	[07:52:58] Kelet, thanks for your help btw
2013-06-27 14:53:26	norbu	[07:55:18] I'm reading an SDL tutorial and instead of calling SDL_FreeSurface() over and over by hand for each pointer, I'd like to store all the pointers in an array, iterate over all the elements of the array and destroy each of them. Is this possible?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	norbu	[07:55:35] I mean, destroy each pointer
2013-06-27 14:53:26	skeuomorf	[07:55:56] hey inf-groupoid
2013-06-27 14:53:26	boldfilter	[08:04:31] I like to try and understand the concepts as well
2013-06-27 14:53:26	mimphino	[08:37:04] What's a legitimate size for the legitimate 'max' amount of TCP connections inwards? I'm considering making a 'server' where clients have to have INSTANT notifications of events, and, considering clients are going to have firewalls keeping TCP connections open seems to be my only option.
2013-06-27 14:53:26	+Billiard	[08:39:48] 9
2013-06-27 14:53:26	glenfe	[08:40:26] It depends on multiple things; if you were hoping for a simple numerical value answer to that question you are probably going to be disappointed.
2013-06-27 14:53:26	SolarBear	[08:41:25] 9
2013-06-27 14:53:26	+Billiard	[08:41:47] ^
2013-06-27 14:53:26	mimphino	[08:45:07] TCP connection pool 'max' size?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	SolarBear	[08:46:08] Depends on your DHT x86 registers
2013-06-27 14:53:26	mimphino	[08:49:37] Billiard: SolarBear Why 9?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	SolarBear	[08:49:58] Because eax registers
2013-06-27 14:53:26	+Billiard	[08:53:46] 9 is a "legitimate size"
2013-06-27 14:53:26	+Billiard	[08:54:02] being a positive integer
2013-06-27 14:53:26	mimphino	[08:57:47] SolarBear: What about eax registers?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	mimphino	[08:58:02] Billiard: So it can be 8 aswell? any positive integer?
2013-06-27 14:53:26	stairmast0r	[10:48:56] shit only 125wpm lol
2013-06-27 14:53:26	stairmast0r	[10:49:15] anyone here use an apple keyboard with not a mac?

2013-06-28 10:10:01	+hyuke	[04:55:43] so, 480,000 bits = 60000 bytes = 60 kb ?
2013-06-28 10:10:01	coveiro	[04:55:58] yeah
2013-06-28 10:10:01	+hyuke	[04:56:09] 60kb does not sound like a lot of memory
2013-06-28 10:10:01	+AngelFish	[04:56:14] it is
2013-06-28 10:10:01	+AngelFish	[04:56:30] You'd be surprised how much code can fit into 60Kb.
2013-06-28 10:10:01	+hyuke	[04:57:02] it's being stored in the RAM, correct?
2013-06-28 10:10:01	coveiro	[04:57:21] yeah
2013-06-28 10:10:01	+hyuke	[04:57:37] so, my computer in 1994 with 8mb of ram could have held that without a problem, right?
2013-06-28 10:10:01	coveiro	[04:57:46] not exactly
2013-06-28 10:10:01	coveiro	[04:57:57] theres a thing called process page or something like that
2013-06-28 10:10:01	coveiro	[04:58:25] just because you have 6GB of ram in your computer, it doesn't mean that every process has 6GB of memory
2013-06-28 10:10:01	+hyuke	[04:59:06] ah, so my OS is deciding "this process gets 'x' amount of ram" ?
2013-06-28 10:10:01	coveiro	[04:59:15] something like that
2013-06-28 10:10:01	+hyuke	[04:59:16] and 'x' may be smaller than I imagine
2013-06-28 10:10:01	coveiro	[04:59:54] here's a nice place to start learning this stuff: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_table
2013-06-28 10:10:01	+hyuke	[05:00:51] so, if I do not know up front how many rows of data I will have, what's the best approach?
2013-06-28 10:10:01	coveiro	[05:01:13] read one line at a time
2013-06-28 10:10:01	+hyuke	[05:01:25] even with 120,000 lines?
2013-06-28 10:10:01	+hyuke	[05:01:39] I mean, I guess i++ 120,000 times probably does not take any time at all
2013-06-28 10:10:01	coveiro	[05:01:45] it doesnt
2013-06-28 10:10:01	+hyuke	[05:01:48] I don't know what the comparison takes
2013-06-28 10:10:01	coveiro	[05:01:57] some nanoseconds
2013-06-28 10:10:01	coveiro	[05:01:59] its all fast
2013-06-28 10:10:01	+hyuke	[05:02:07] ah
2013-06-28 10:10:01	+hyuke	[05:02:14] I will stick with one line at a time then :)
2013-06-28 10:10:01	+hyuke	[05:02:18] thanks for all your help
2013-06-28 10:10:01	coveiro	[05:02:44] try making a program that finds the number of possible magic squares of edge n
2013-06-28 10:10:01	coveiro	[05:02:55] by trying every permutation
2013-06-28 10:10:01	coveiro	[05:03:02] and then you'll see whats a slow program
2013-06-28 10:10:01	coveiro	[05:03:10] 3x3 magic squares its okay
2013-06-28 10:10:01	coveiro	[05:03:33] 4x4 squares, it takes between two weeks and one month if not more
2013-06-28 10:10:01	+hyuke	[05:06:08] oh, i've seen some groundwater models that take weeks to run, so I am used to that
2013-06-28 10:10:01	+hyuke	[05:06:28] I usually don't worry about that kind of thing, but I am writing an algorithm for someone else who is giving me money
2013-06-28 10:10:01	+hyuke	[05:06:48] and I thought I would have some integrity this time :P

2013-06-28 10:10:01	b1tstorm	[05:57:25] Hello #programming! I have a question about whether a UDP server can be forking or threaded, or whether the server has to serve requests serially. Any takers?
2013-06-28 10:10:01	+wei2912	[05:58:38] no idea, b1tstorm
2013-06-28 10:10:01	b1tstorm	[06:00:48] hmm, ok. Any idea where else may be a good place to ask? I've asked in the IRC channel for the language in which it would be written as well..
2013-06-28 10:10:01	NPCompL337	[06:01:20] use python
2013-06-28 10:10:01	b1tstorm	[06:02:02] haha - I sure am.
2013-06-28 10:10:01	b1tstorm	[06:02:19] at least until I learn more about it or I have the need for a lower-level language
2013-06-28 10:10:01	maslen	[06:02:40] #networking ? But generally, since UDP is "send and forget", I don't think there would be a huge benefit to spawning off lots of processes or threads.
2013-06-28 10:10:01	b1tstorm	[06:05:17] yea - I know what you mean, but I'm looking into learning DNS by writing a DNS proxy
2013-06-28 10:10:01	cryptc	[06:06:35] Anyone use C++11?
2013-06-28 10:10:01	cryptc	[06:07:16] As in, you've converted to the new standard
2013-06-28 10:10:01	+Technodrome	[06:07:32] so not sure what i want to do right now

2013-06-28 12:40:42	foolcool	[07:59:11] I am beginning to absolutely hate java
2013-06-28 12:40:42	foolcool	[07:59:28] I use c++ but I liked java and now I have to write a super object oriented thing and it sucks
2013-06-28 12:40:42	+Kelet	[08:02:03] foolcool, why
2013-06-28 12:40:42	navigataur	[08:02:03] java isn't for high-end or high-performance stuff, imho
2013-06-28 12:40:42	navigataur	[08:02:17] space shuttles running java, pfffffft
2013-06-28 12:40:42	foolcool	[08:02:25] even just solving project euler
2013-06-28 12:40:42	foolcool	[08:02:31] it's going to take me forever
2013-06-28 12:40:42	navigataur	[08:02:34] nuclear power plants running java.... pffffft. Societies needs c++
2013-06-28 12:40:42	foolcool	[08:02:35] and it doesn't even support go to
2013-06-28 12:40:42	foolcool	[08:02:44] like what the fuck is that
2013-06-28 12:40:42	foolcool	[08:02:57] the case statements suck
2013-06-28 12:40:42	foolcool	[08:03:17] I have to type fucking system.out.print instead of cout <<
2013-06-28 12:40:42	+Kelet	[08:03:23] I find it to be a satisfactory language, why are you using it if you don't like it?
2013-06-28 12:40:42	navigataur	[08:03:28] or elivators running java O_o .. or industrial robots on java..  what a .. bad idea
2013-06-28 12:40:42	foolcool	[08:03:33] because I want to show to a future employer
2013-06-28 12:40:42	foolcool	[08:03:44] who wants me to do object oriented java development
2013-06-28 12:40:42	navigataur	[08:03:53] foolcool: would you fly an aeroplane that's running on java?
2013-06-28 12:40:42	navigataur	[08:04:10] however, there's a lot of things you would code in java.
2013-06-28 12:40:42	navigataur	[08:04:22] sorry, I'm having a monologue here
2013-06-28 12:40:42	foolcool	[08:04:24] it's great for OO but OO takes forver
2013-06-28 12:40:42	+Kelet	[08:04:27] If the aeroplane has a computer system complex enough to use java for some high-level things, why not
2013-06-28 12:40:42	foolcool	[08:04:36] java doesn't crash
2013-06-28 12:40:42	+Kelet	[08:04:45] But otherwise that's like saying "Why would you use a high-level language for a low-level application" which is pretty obvious
2013-06-28 12:40:42	navigataur	[08:05:04] Kelet: indeed ;)
2013-06-28 12:40:42	+Kelet	[08:05:15] Just like you wouldn't use C for a web scraper
2013-06-28 12:40:42	+Kelet	[08:05:27] Well I guess some people have, but I'm sure some have used Java on weird stuff too.
2013-06-28 12:40:42	navigataur	[08:05:28] a navigation system could just as well be coded in java
2013-06-28 12:40:42	+Kelet	[08:06:00] If I hated a language I wouldn't be interested in being employed programming it
2013-06-28 12:40:42	+Kelet	[08:06:13] Although I guess some think of work as work and as such don't care to try and enjoy it
2013-06-28 12:40:42	+Kelet	[08:07:08] Anyhow, maybe you should consider learning a JVM language that isn't Java
2013-06-28 12:40:42	+Kelet	[08:07:28] for example in Groovy or Scala, I believe    println("Hello World!") is a valid program
2013-06-28 12:40:42	foolcool	[08:07:39] i like c++
2013-06-28 12:40:42	foolcool	[08:08:01] it's perfect for what i need most of the time
2013-06-28 12:40:42	foolcool	[08:08:10] and visual studio is great
2013-06-28 12:40:42	foolcool	[08:08:18] i run a virtual box of win7 to use visual studio

2013-07-03 08:03:39	+SunFish	[03:16:38] Until 2008, no one had resolved those problems
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+Nisstyre	[03:16:39] SunFish: which is false...because TCO only happens with functions that are TAIL RECURSIVE
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+min|dvir|us	[03:16:50] 19:15 <+Nisstyre> like, he thinks it would make stack traces useless
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+Denommus	[03:16:52] Nisstyre: as I said, MRI people agree on this. Ruby 2.0 does implement TCO, but you have to activate it manually on your image. It's not default because stack trace
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+min|dvir|us	[03:16:59] That would make sense given a shitty implementation of TCO.
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+Nisstyre	[03:17:12] min|dvir|us: yes, it could happen in a naive implementation of it
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+min|dvir|us	[03:17:58] A problem I see is not being able to properly inspect the variables in the stack trace.
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+jrslepak	[03:18:02] SunFish: related -- http://www.brinckerhoff.org/clements/papers/cf-toplas04.pdf
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+min|dvir|us	[03:18:11] In that case TCO should be disabled during debugging.
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+SunFish	[03:18:11] http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.69.3133&rep=rep1&type=pdf
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+SunFish	[03:18:12] Damn it
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+SunFish	[03:18:24] We linked the same thing
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+jrslepak	[03:18:27] haha
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+SunFish	[03:18:34] Although, the actual paper I was thinking of was from 2008
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+SunFish	[03:18:41] That's from '04
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+SunFish	[03:19:13] In any case, the only reason it's not in java is because no one wants to do it.
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+jrslepak	[03:19:14] I haven't read the '04 one, but I did implement another one of Clements's papers for homework once
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+Denommus	[03:19:47] Java doesn't do anything
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+Denommus	[03:19:58] look at the time they're getting to implement lambda
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+Denommus	[03:20:12] it's impressive, giving how many people use Java
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+Nisstyre	[03:20:23] jrslepak: does Racket do this?
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+jrslepak	[03:20:58] Nisstyre: Racket has continuation marks, but IIRC they differ a bit from what Clements devised
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+jrslepak	[03:21:16] and I don't know all that much about how Racket implements its stack tracing
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+Nisstyre	[03:21:17] cool
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+occ	[03:28:11] is anyone good with disk partitioning errors?
2013-07-03 08:03:39	Somelauw	[03:30:37] scala has some kind of TCO which can be enabled using a what-is-the-@-thing-called.
2013-07-03 08:03:39	Somelauw	[03:30:56] Just put @tailrecursion or something above it
2013-07-03 08:03:39	Somelauw	[03:31:07] and python can also hack it in using similar syntax
2013-07-03 08:03:39	Somelauw	[03:31:23] and gnu C also seems to have TCO
2013-07-03 08:03:39	Somelauw	[03:31:32] gcc*
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+Denommus	[03:34:38] occ: I think you should look for sysadmin channels, like #linux
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+occ	[03:35:51] ok
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+someoneigna	[03:40:22] I suck so bad at GUI programming xD
2013-07-03 08:03:39	paracyst	[03:43:36] i just made a custom gui for my mozilla xul app
2013-07-03 08:03:39	paracyst	[03:43:44] was a huge nightmare
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+someoneigna	[03:45:46] I'm about to commit suicide with Java way of doing GUI programming.
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+someoneigna	[03:47:15] All I wanted was a box with text, and change that text with the Timer, but NO, you need to override all the fucking methods of every Listener xD.
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+dw	[03:47:26] paracyst: what made you go with XUL?
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+someoneigna	[03:47:32] (A crappy clock with an alarm that is)
2013-07-03 08:03:39	Buzzy	[03:48:26] someoneigna, can't you just update the text when each timer event occurs?
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+someoneigna	[03:48:34] I need to integrate the Java docs with Idea.
2013-07-03 08:03:39	paracyst	[03:48:39] the app is basically a pretty way of viewing a web page, so it seemed easy enough
2013-07-03 08:03:39	+dw	[03:49:14] paracyst: i just hadn't heard of anyone using xul for something new in.. oh.. 9 years :)
2013-07-03 08:03:40	+someoneigna	[03:50:10] Buzzy I'm trying to use setActionCommand(String command) I was expecting something as simple as if timer.getDelay() >= timer.chosenDelay(){  date = "" + date; time.insert(date, 0); clockApp.redraw(); } xD
2013-07-03 08:03:40	+Denommus	[03:50:11] anyone with experience in cmake?
2013-07-03 08:03:40	+Denommus	[03:50:28] I want to run a script when running "cmake ..", but this script must run from within a directory
2013-07-03 08:03:40	+Denommus	[03:50:32] is there a way to acomplish that?
2013-07-03 08:03:40	+someoneigna	[03:50:33] But trying to respect the OOP way is getting me on my nerves.
2013-07-03 08:03:40	+Denommus	[03:52:15] found out. Thanks
2013-07-03 08:03:40	+someoneigna	[03:59:01] Well, now the inner class... I hate Java again.

2013-07-03 10:45:05	+Remram	took a while
2013-07-03 10:45:08	+RRR2	I'd do it, because I rather not waste others people time, for example like me, I've been trying to compile something for about 2 hours with no luck
2013-07-03 10:45:09	+Zeno`	Although building Qt from source on Windows isn't exactly fun, lol
2013-07-03 10:45:17	+Zeno`	Remram, yeah
2013-07-03 10:45:18	+Remram	took some hacking too
2013-07-03 10:45:36	+Remram	because VC++ version changed, because min/max are macros on VC++
2013-07-03 10:45:48	+Zeno`	Last time I compiled it I had to leave out all of WebKit ROFL
2013-07-03 10:45:50	+Zeno`	oh well
2013-07-03 10:46:04	+Remram	webkit builds, you just have to tweak two functions with weird templates
2013-07-03 10:46:17	+Zeno`	Remram, yeah, but I was lazy :D
2013-07-03 10:46:18	+Remram	workaround is known (it's on stackoverflow)
2013-07-03 10:46:33	+Zeno`	And I didn't need it at the time so just avoided it hehehe
2013-07-03 10:46:50	+Remram	clearly it would have easier if the Qt folks had had 64bit binaries

2013-07-03 11:35:47	+jrslepak	I've been working on a vaguely J-like language for parallel programming
2013-07-03 11:36:09	+jrslepak	the main reason I came here was to study language design
2013-07-03 11:37:28	+arubin	Array programming language?

2013-07-03 11:44:05	Nisstyre	arubin: idk if that is something that I'd be really interested in
2013-07-03 11:44:15	Nisstyre	seems pretty Scala and Clojure centric

2013-07-03 11:44:45	Nisstyre	CUFP
2013-07-03 11:44:56	+jrslepak	ICFP definitely doesn't look Scala/Clojure-centric
2013-07-03 11:45:19	+arubin	Nisstyre: Most conferences are just as much about getting together with like-minded people as they are about attending talks.
2013-07-03 11:45:36	Nisstyre	arubin: tbh I'd like to go to defcon next year
2013-07-03 11:45:40	+arubin	Nisstyre: I do not think that the CUFP talks are listed yet either.
2013-07-03 11:45:46	+arubin	Only the workshops.
2013-07-03 11:46:14	+arubin	I am not sure why you think that it is Scala/Clojure centric though.
2013-07-03 11:46:23	+jrslepak	Matt Might mentioned not planning to go to any talks at a conference he helped organize Â¬_Â¬
2013-07-03 11:46:24	Nisstyre	arubin: just my impression from looking at the front page
2013-07-03 11:46:30	+arubin	There is a two-day Haskell workshop and a total of one day each for Scala and Clojure.
2013-07-03 11:46:53	Nisstyre	arubin: what would I get out of a haskell workshop?
2013-07-03 11:46:59	Nisstyre	I mean, I've never done this sort of thing
2013-07-03 11:47:01	+arubin	Plus a day for Erlang and a day for OCaml.
2013-07-03 11:47:12	+arubin	Nisstyre: Learn Haskell from an expert.
2013-07-03 11:47:21	Nisstyre	I can already do that by going to #haskell

2013-07-03 11:50:37	+arubin	Nisstyre: I have had some interesting experiences by attending conferences, like having dinner at a great Indian restaurant with a PostgreSQL core member and another well-known PostgreSQL figure.
2013-07-03 11:50:49	+arubin	jrslepak: Not sure. I did not plan this trip to attend anything like that, but it might be worthwhile.

2013-07-03 11:51:50	+arubin	The second day of workshops really works better for me, so it would probably be Clojure or Scala.
2013-07-03 11:51:53	+arubin	Not really sure though.
2013-07-03 11:52:01	+arubin	I was not planning on being in Boston before Wednesday.

2013-07-03 11:52:44	Nisstyre	so it will be fairly challenging
2013-07-03 11:53:12	+arubin	Nisstyre: There is also a Haskell Symposium during ICFP.

2013-07-03 17:07:28	arathald	[10:50:07] A while ago, I found a set of online tutorials for different languages that moved fast (i.e. appropriate for an established coder to learn a new language) and was kind of irreverant... but I can't seem to find them. Anyone know what I'm talking about that can link me?
2013-07-03 17:07:28	SirCmpwn	[10:50:45] arathald: http://learnxinyminutes.com/ ?
2013-07-03 17:07:28	arathald	[10:51:40] I don't think that was it, but it may do me well. I have an interview that I'm meant to know Java for, and I haven't touched it in a few years.
2013-07-03 17:07:28	SirCmpwn	[10:51:59] I suggest you continue not touching java and interview elsewhere
2013-07-03 17:07:28	arathald	[10:53:14] They use Java for Android apps. It's not a requirement for the job, but it'll make the interview go a bit more smoothly.
2013-07-03 17:07:28	brandan	[10:54:10] hello

2013-07-03 17:07:28	arathald	[10:54:57] The interview is for Amazon, in a division I really like, so a bit of Java isn't going to put me off :) The job is mostly web dev
2013-07-03 17:07:28	SirCmpwn	[10:55:45] Amazon sounds like a company I'd tolerate Java for
2013-07-03 17:07:28	arathald	[10:55:48] (not web dev in Java... it's mostly not Java)
2013-07-03 17:07:28	tneva82	[11:04:10] the feeling when you screw up formula you intended to write but which actually works while the way you intended to write doesn't. By all logic this should not work but somehow it does. Not sure how good it is there's bit of math there I don't understand myself even if it works perfectly!

2013-07-03 17:07:28	jhpy1024	[12:28:39] I'm reading the book "Beginning Java: Java 7 Edition" and I've got upto reading/writing files and there's about 30 pages on writing to buffers etc. Do I need to know this or is there a simple, shorter, way
2013-07-03 17:07:28	+Znoosey	[12:33:55] jhpy1024, there is no need to know it by heart... just skim through it and remember where in the book you can find it
2013-07-03 17:07:28	+Znoosey	[12:34:31] it is more the mindset of how to think that is important, by using buffers to do stuff faster
2013-07-03 17:07:28	jhpy1024	[12:36:15] I understand that buffers are more efficient, it's just that this book almost goes into too much detail and it gets quite boring
2013-07-03 17:07:28	+Znoosey	[12:36:43] jhpy1024, yes they tend to do that
2013-07-03 17:07:28	+Znoosey	[12:37:11] so just skim it... it is not important until you have to do some high intensity reading/writing to files
2013-07-03 17:07:28	jhpy1024	[12:37:52] Okay thanks, I'll note down where I can find this stuff
2013-07-03 17:07:28	jhpy1024	[12:37:57] if I need it in the future.

Example Code in C++ what I used for my bot, which i want to translate to Python too: DWORD HPPointer = *(DWORD*)(*(DWORD*)0x1079878 + 0x2144) + 0x68;  I think it should be possible with ctypes, but didn't find any helpful advice in google so far.
